IfcOpenShell 
============
open source (LGPL) software library for working with the IFC file format


http://IfcOpenShell.org


Compiling on Windows
====================
Users are advised to use the Visual Studio .sln file in the win/ folder.
For Windows users a prebuilt Open CASCADE version is available from the
http://opencascade.org website. Download and install this version and
provide the paths to the Open CASCADE header and library files to MS
Visual Studio C++.

For building the Autodesk 3ds Max plugin, the 3ds Max SDK needs to be
installed as well as 3ds Max itself. Please provide the include and
library paths to Visual Studio.

For building the IfcPython wrapper, SWIG needs to be installed. Please
download the latest swigwin version from http://www.swig.org/download.html.
After extracting the .zip file, please add the extracted folder to the PATH
environment variable. Python needs to be installed, please provide the
include and library paths to Visual Studio.



Compiling on *nix
====================
Users are advised to build IfcOpenShell using the cmake file provided in
the cmake/ folder. There might be an Open CASCADE package in your operating
system's software repository. If not, you will need to compile Open 
CASCADE yourself. See http://opencascade.org.

For building the IfcPython wrapper, SWIG and Python development are
required.

To build IfcOpenShell please take the following steps:
$ cd /path/to/IfcOpenShell/cmake
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
Optionally:
  $ OCC_INCLUDE_PATH="/path/to/OpenCASCADE/include"
  $ OCC_LIBRARY_PATH="/path/to/OpenCASCADE/lib"
  $ export OCC_INCLUDE_PATH
  $ export OCC_LIBRARY_PATH
$ cmake ../
$ make

If all worked out correctly you can now use IfcOpenShell. For example:
$ wget ftp://ftp.dds.no/pub/ifc/Munkerud/Munkerud_hus6_BE.zip
$ unzip Munkerud_hus6_BE.zip
$ ./IfcObj Munkerud_hus6_BE.ifc
$ less Munkerud_hus6_BE.obj
Or:
$ wget ftp://ftp.dds.no/pub/ifc/Munkerud/Munkerud_hus6_BE.zip
$ unzip Munkerud_hus6_BE.zip
$ python
>>> import IfcImport
>>> IfcImport.Init('Munkerud_hus6_BE.ifc')
>>> geom = IfcImport.Get()
>>> geom.name
>>> for v in geom.mesh.verts: v
