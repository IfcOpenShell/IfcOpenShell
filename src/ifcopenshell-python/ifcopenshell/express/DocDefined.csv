<ul>

<p>A value of 'normal' selects a font that is classified as 'normal' in the user agents font database, while 'oblique' selects a font that is labeled 'oblique'. A value of 'italic' selects a font that is labeled 'italic', or, if that is not available, one labeled 'oblique'. The font that is labeled 'oblique' in the user agents font database may actually have been generated by electronically slanting a normal font.
</p>

<p>Fonts with Oblique, Slanted or Incline in their names will typically be labeled 'oblique' in the user agents font database. Fonts with <em>Italic, Cursive</em> or <em>Kursiv</em> in their names will typically be labeled 'italic'.

<p>A value of 'normal' selects a font that is not a small-caps font, 'small-caps' selects a small-caps font. It is acceptable (but not required) in CSS1 if the small-caps font is a created by taking a normal font and replacing the lower case letters by scaled uppercase characters.

304;IfcFontWeight;"<EPM-HTML>

<p><u>Definition from CSS1 (W3C Recommendation)</u>: The 'font-weight' property selects the weight of the font. The values '100' to '900' form an ordered sequence, where each number indicates a weight that is at least as dark as its predecessor. The keyword 'normal' is synonymous with '400', and 'bold' is synonymous with '700'. Keywords other than 'normal' and 'bold' have been shown to be often confused with font names and a numerical scale was therefore chosen for the 9-value list. Values are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>normal </li>
  <li>bold </li>
  <li>100 | 200 | 300 | 400 | 500 | 600 | 700 | 800 | 900</li>
</ul>

<p>Fonts (the font data) typically have one or more properties whose values are names that are descriptive of the ""weight"" of a font. There is no accepted, universal meaning to these weight names. Their primary role is to distinguish faces of differing darkness within a single font family. Usage across font families is quite variant; for example a font that you might think of as being bold might be described as being <em>Regular, Roman, Book, Medium, Semi-</em> or <em>DemiBold, Bold,</em> or <em>Black,</em> depending on how black the ""normal"" face of the font is within the design. Because there is no standard usage of names, the weight property values in CSS1 are given on a numerical scale in which the value '400' (or 'normal') corresponds to the ""normal"" text face for that family. The weight name associated with that face will typically be <em>Book, Regular, Roman, Normal</em> or sometimes <em>Medium</em>.</p>

<p>The association of other weights within a family to the numerical weight values is intended only to preserve the ordering of darkness within that family. However, the following heuristics tell how the assignment is done in typical cases:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If the font family already uses a numerical scale with nine values (such as with <em>OpenType</em>), the font weights should be mapped directly. </li>
  <li>If there is both a face labeled <em>Medium</em> and one labeled <em>Book, Regular, Roman</em> or <em>Normal,</em> then the <em>Medium</em> is normally assigned to the '500'. </li>
  <li>The font labeled ""Bold"" will often correspond to the weight value '700'. </li>
  <li>If there are fewer then 9 weights in the family, the default algorithm for filling the ""holes"" is as follows. If '500' is unassigned, it will be assigned the same font as '400'. If any of the values '600', '700', '800' or '900' remains unassigned, they are assigned to the same face as the next darker assigned keyword, if any, or the next lighter one otherwise. If any of '300', '200' or '100' remains unassigned, it is assigned to the next lighter assigned keyword, if any, or the next darker otherwise. </li>
</ul>

<p>The following two examples illustrate the process. Assume four weights in the ""Example1"" family, from lightest to darkest: <em>Regular, Medium, Bold, Heavy.</em> And assume six weights in the ""Example2"" family: <em>Book, Medium, Bold, Heavy, Black, ExtraBlack.</em> Note how in the second example it has been decided <em>not</em> to assign ""Example2 ExtraBlack"" to anything.
</p>

<p><b>Use in string representations</b></p>

<p>When a compound plane angle measure is formatted for display or printout, the signs of the fractional components will usually be discarded because, to a human reader, the sign of the first component alone already indicates the sense of the angle:</p>

<blockquote><code>
(* convert from compound to human-readable string *)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;s := FORMAT(c[1], '+##') &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ &quot;000000B0&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ FORMAT(ABS(c[2]), '##') + ''''<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ FORMAT(ABS(c[3]), '##') + '&quot;'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ FORMAT(ABS(c[4]), '##'); &nbsp;-- -50&deg; 58' 33&quot; 110400
</code></blockquote>

<p>Another often encountered display format of latitudes and longitudes is to omit the signs and print N, S, E, W indicators instead, for example, <code>50&deg;58'33&quot;S</code>.  When stored as <i>IfcCompoundPlaneAngleMeasure</i> however, a compound plane angle measure is always signed, with same sign of all components.</p>

<p><u>Definition from ISO/CD 10303-42</u>:1992: A dimension count is a positive integer used to define the coordinate space dimensionality. </p> 

<p>The <I>IfcDimensionCount</I> is restricted to have the dimensionality of either 1, 2, or 3 - the WR1 had been added as an addition to the ISO 10303:42 entity dimension_count. In contrary to the ISO 10303:42 constraint, that all geometric representation items within a geometric representation context are forced to have the same dimension count, the IFC geometry allows mixed dimensions, particularly when defining the boundary of planar surfaces. </p>

NOTE Corresponding ISO 10303 type: dimension_count, please refer to ISO/IS 10303-42:1994, p. 14 for the final definition of the formal standard.
