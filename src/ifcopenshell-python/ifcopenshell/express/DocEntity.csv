292;IfcTextStyleFontModel;"<EPM-HTML>

<p><u>Definition from CSS1 (W3C Recommendation)</u>: Setting font properties will be among the most common uses of style sheets. Unfortunately, there exists no well-defined and universally accepted taxonomy for classifying fonts, and terms that apply to one font family may not be appropriate for others. For example, 'italic' is commonly used to label slanted text, but slanted text may also be labeled as being <i>Oblique</i>, <i>Slanted</i>, <i>Incline</i>, <i>Cursive</i> or <i>Kursiv</i>. Therefore it is not a simple problem to map typical font selection properties to a specific font.</p>

<p><b>Font matching</b></p>
<p>Because there is no accepted, universal taxonomy of font properties, matching of properties to font faces must be done carefully. The properties are matched in a well-defined order to ensure that the results of this matching process are as consistent as possible across user agents (assuming that the same library of font faces is presented to each of them).
</p>

<ol>
  <li>The user agent makes (or
accesses) a database of relevant CSS1
properties of all the fonts of which the UA is aware. The UA may be
aware of a font because it has been installed locally or it has been
previously downloaded over the web. If there are two fonts with
exactly the same properties, one of them is ignored. </li>
  <li>At a given element and for
each character in that element, the UA
assembles the font-properties applicable to that element. Using the
complete set of properties, the UA uses the 'font-family' property to
choose a tentative font family. The remaining properties are tested
against the family according to the matching criteria described with
each property. If there are matches for all the remaining properties,
then that is the matching font face for the given element. </li>
  <li>If there is no matching font
face within the 'font-family' being
processed by step 2, and if there is a next alternative 'font-family'
in the font set, then repeat step 2 with the next alternative
'font-family'. </li>
  <li>If there is a matching font
face, but it doesn't contain a glyph
for the current character, and if there is a next alternative
'font-family' in the font sets, then repeat step 2 with the next
alternative 'font-family'.&nbsp; </li>
  <li>If there is no font within
the family selected in 2, then use a
UA-dependent default 'font-family' and repeat step 2, using the best
match that can be obtained within the default font. </li>
</ol>
<p>(The above algorithm can be
optimized to avoid having to revisit
the CSS1 properties for each character.)
</p>
<p>The per-property matching rules
from (2) above are as follows:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>'font-style' is tried first.
'italic'
will be satisfied if there is either a face in the UA's font database
labeled with the CSS keyword 'italic' (preferred) or 'oblique'.
Otherwise the values must be matched exactly or font-style will fail. </li>
  <li>'font-variant' is tried
next. 'normal'
matches a font not labeled as 'small-caps'; 'small-caps' matches (1) a
font labeled as 'small-caps', (2) a font in which the small caps are
synthesized, or (3) a font where all lowercase letters are replaced by
upper case letters. A small-caps font may be synthesized by
electronically scaling uppercase letters from a normal font. </li>
  <li>'font-weight' is matched next, it will never fail. (See 'font-weight' below.) </li>
  <li>'font-size' must be matched within a
UA-dependent margin of tolerance. (Typically, sizes for scalable fonts
are rounded to the nearest whole pixel, while the tolerance for
bitmapped fonts could be as large as 20%.) Further computations, are
based on the 'font-size' value that is used, not the one that is specified.</li>
</ol>

<p>The inherited <i>Name</i> attribute is used to define the font name, particularly in cases, where no (list of) font families are provided. </p>

    <p>
      A property with a range value
      (<i>IfcPropertyTableValue</i>) defines a property object
      which has two lists of (numeric or descriptive) values
      assigned, the values specifying a table with two columns.
      The defining values provide the first column and establish
      the scope for the defined values (the second column).
      Interpolations are out of scope of the
      <i>IfcPropertyTableValue</i>. An optional <i>Expression</i>
      attribute may give the equation used for deriving the range
      value, which is for information purposes only.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>IfcPropertyTableValue</i> defines a defining/defined
      property value combination for which the property name, the
      table with defining and defined values with measure type
      (and optional the units for defining and defined values)
      are given.
    </p>
    <p>
      The units are handled by the <i>DefiningUnit</i> and
      <i>DefinedUnit</i> attributes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>If the <i>DefiningUnit</i> or <i>DefinedUnit</i>
      attribute is not given, then the unit is already implied by
      the type of <i>IfcMeasureValue</i> or
      <i>IfcDerivedMeasureValue</i>. The associated unit can be
      found at the <i>IfcUnitAssignment</i> globally defined at
      the project level (<i>IfcProject.UnitsInContext</i>).
      </li>
      <li>If the <i>DefiningUnit</i> or <i>DefinedUnit</i>
      attribute is given, then the unit assigned by the unit
      attribute overrides the globally assigned unit.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The <i>IfcPropertyTableValue</i> allows for the
      specification of a table of defining/defined value pairs of
      the property description. <font color=""#0000ff"">The optional 
			attribute <i>CurveInterpolation</i> allows to determine the

included in a storey. A space can also be decomposed in parts,
where each part defines a partial space. This is defined by the

<i>IfcSpatialStructureElement</i> which is interpreted as
follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>COMPLEX = space group</li>
<li>ELEMENT = space</li>
<li>PARTIAL = partial space</li>

agreements may restrict spaces with <i>CompositionType</i>=ELEMENT
to be non-overlapping.</small></blockquote>
<p>The following guidelines should apply for using the <i>Name</i>,
<i>Description</i>, <i>LongName</i> and <i>ObjectType</i>
attributes.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Name</i> holds the unique name (or space number) from the
plan.</li>
<li><i>Description</i> holds any additional information field the
user may have specified, there are no further recommendations.</li>
<li><i>LongName</i> holds the full name of the space, it is often
used in addition to the <i>Name</i>, if a number is assigned to the
room, then the descriptive name is exchanged as
<i>LongName</i>.</li>
<li><i>ObjectType</i> holds the space type, i.e. usually the

linked together by using the objectified relationship
<i>IfcRelAggregates</i>. The <i>IfcSpace</i> references them by its

<ul>
<li><i>IfcSpace.Decomposes</i> -- referencing (<i>IfcSite</i> ||
<i>IfcBuildingStorey</i> || <i>IfcSpace</i>) by
<i>IfcRelAggregates.RelatingObject</i>, If it refers to another
instance of&nbsp;<i>IfcSpace</i>, the referenced <i>IfcSpace</i>
needs to have a different and higher <i>CompositionType</i>, i.e.
COMPLEX (if the other <i>IfcSpace</i> has ELEMENT), or ELEMENT (if
the other <i>IfcSpace</i> has PARTIAL).</li>
<li><i>IfcSpace.IsDecomposedBy</i> -- referencing (<i>IfcSpace</i>)
by <i>IfcRelAggregates.RelatedObjects</i>. If it refers to another
instance of <i>IfcSpace</i>, the referenced <i>IfcSpace</i> needs
to have a different and lower <i>CompositionType</i>, i.e. ELEMENT
(if the other <i>IfcSpace</i> has COMPLEX), or PARTIAL (if the
other <i>IfcSpace</i> has ELEMENT).</li>
</ul>
<p>If there are building elements and/or other elements directly
related to the <i>IfcSpace</i>&nbsp;(like most furniture and
distribution elements), they are associated with the
<i>IfcSpace</i> by using the objectified relationship
<i>IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure</i>. The <i>IfcSpace</i>
references them by its inverse relationship:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>IfcSpace.ContainsElements</i> -- referencing any subtype of

<p><b><u>Type Use Definition</u></b></p>
<p>The <i>IfcDistributionElement</i> defines the occurrence of
any HVAC, electrical, sanitary or other element within a
distribution system. Common information about distribution
element types (or styles) is handled by subtypes of
<i>IfcDistributionElementType</i>. The
<i>IfcDistributionElementType</i> (if present) may establish the
common type name, usage (or predefined) type, common material,
common set of properties and common shape representations (using
<i>IfcRepresentationMap</i>). The
<i>IfcDistributionElementType</i> is attached using the
<i>IfcRelDefinedByType.RelatingType</i> objectified relationship
and is accessible by the inverse <i>IsDefinedBy</i>
attribute.</p>
<p>The assignment of types to distribution element occurrences is
vital for providing the additional meaning, or ontology, of the
distribution element. Many specialized type are defined in other
schemas of the IFC specification.</p>

<p><u><b>Containment Use Definition</b></u></p>
<p>The <i>IfcDistributionElement</i> may participate in two
different containment relationships. The first (and in most
implementation scenarios mandatory) relationship is the
hierachical spatial containment, the second (optional)
relationship is the aggregation within anÿelement assembly.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <i>IfcDistributionElement</i> is places within the
project spatial hierarchy using the objectified relationship
<i>IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure</i>, referring to it by its
inverse attribute <i>SELF\IfcElement.ContainedInStructure</i>.
Subtypes ofÿ<i>IfcSpatialStructureElement</i> are valid spatial
containers, with <i>IfcSpace</i> being the default
container.</li>
<li>The <i>IfcDistributionElement</i> may be aggregated into an
element assembly using the objectified relationship
<i>IfcRelAggregates</i>, referring to it by its inverse attribute
<i>SELF\IfcObjectDefinition.Decomposes</i>. Any subtype of
<i>IfcElement</i> can be an element assembly, with
<i>IfcElementAssembly</i> as a special focus subtype. In this
case it should not be additionally contained in the project
spatial hierarchy,
i.e.ÿ<i>SELF\IfcElement.ContainedInStructure</i> should be
<i>NIL.</i></li>
</ul>
<p><b><u>Geometry Use Definitions</u></b></p>
<p>The geometric representation of <i>IfcDistributionElement</i>
is given by the <i>IfcProductDefinitionShape</i>, allowing
multiple geometric representation.</p>
<p><b>Local Placement</b></p>
<p>The local placement for <i>IfcDistributionElement</i> is
defined in its supertype <i>IfcProduct</i>. It is defined by the
<i>IfcLocalPlacement</i>, which defines the local coordinate
system that is referenced by all geometric representations.</p>
<ul>

placement of the same <i>IfcSpatialStructureElement</i> , which
is used in the <i>ContainedInStructure</i> inverse attribute, or
to a spatial structure element at a higher level, referenced by
that.</li>
<li>If the relative placement is not used, the absolute placement
is defined within the world coordinate system.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Geometric Representations</b></p>
<p>The geometric representation of <i>IfcDistributionElement</i>
is defined using different geometric representation types for the
various subtypes. Only general recommendations are given at the
level of the supertype, further constraints are defined at the
level of its subtypes.</p>
<ul>
<li>all occurrences of <i>IfcDistributionElement</i> (and its
subtypes) should (whenever possible) share a representation map
established by the assigned type. The geometric representation of
the occurrence is then an <i>IfcMappedItem</i>. The
<i>IfcShapeRepresentation</i> has:
<ul>
<li><i>RepresentationIdentifier</i> : 'Body'</li>
<li><i>RepresentationType</i> : 'MappedRepresentation'</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The shared geometric representation of the distribution
element type (or in some cases of the distribution element)
should follow (if applicable) the the following guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>all fixtures (all non distribution flow elements, i.e.
everything which is not a duct, a pipe, a cable, or a cable
carrier) should be defined by an b-rep geometry. This includes
also the complex flow fitting elements (e.g. Y branch or T
branch) or distribution flow elements with size changes (e.g.
reducer). The <i>IfcShapeRepresentation</i> has:
<ul>
<li><i>RepresentationIdentifier</i> : 'Body'</li>
<li><i>RepresentationType</i> : 'Brep'<br>
<br></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>if the geometric model consistency of a b-rep shape
representation can not be guaranteed (arcwise connected volume
bounded by faces, each being connected, oriented, finite, closed
2-manifold), a surface representation based on open shells should
be used. The <i>IfcShapeRepresentation</i> then has:
<ul>
<li><i>RepresentationIdentifier</i> : 'Body'</li>
<li><i>RepresentationType</i> : 'SurfaceModel'<br>
<br></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>all ""simple"" distribution flow elements (general ducts and
pipes) are defined by sweep geometry. The
<i>IfcShapeRepresentation</i> has:
<ul>
<li><i>RepresentationIdentifier</i> : 'Body'</li>
<li><i>RepresentationType</i> : 'SweptSolid'<br>
<br></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>an additional representation type for all ""simple""
distribution flow elements (general ducts and pipes) is the
ability to have a simple line based representation. The
<i>IfcShapeRepresentation</i> has:
<ul>
<li><i>RepresentationIdentifier</i> : 'FootPrint'</li>
<li><i>RepresentationType</i> : 'GeometricCurveSet'<br>
<br></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>if only the analytical shape is required for which the exact
interpolation between the cross sections is not required, a
sectioned spine can be used.

      <u>Definition from IAI</u>:
      <i>IfcRelConnectsWithRealizingElements</i> defines a
      generic relationship that is made between two elements that
      require the realization of that relationship by means of
      further realizing elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      An <i>IfcRelConnectsWithRealizingElements</i> is a
      specialization of <i>IfcRelConnectsElement</i> where the
      connecting operation has the additional attribute of (one
      or many) realizing elements that may be used to realize or
      further qualify the relationship. It is defined as a
      ternary relationship.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <font size=""-1"">EXAMPLE: It may be used to describe the
        attachment of one element to another where the attachment
        is realized by a 'fixing' element such as a bracket. It
        may also be used to describe the mounting of one element
        onto another such as the requirement for the mounting
        major plant items onto builders work bases and/or
        anti-vibration isolators.</font>

      This objectified relationship,
      <i>IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure</i>, is used to assign
      elements to a certain level of the spatial project
      structure. Any element can only be assigned once to a
      certain level of the spatial structure. The question, which
      level is relevant for which type of element, can only be
      answered within the context of a particular project and
      might vary within the various regions.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <small>EXAMPLE A multi-storey space is contained (or
        belongs to) the building storey at which its ground level
        is, but it is referenced by all the other building
        storeys, in which it spans. A lift shaft might be
        contained by the basement, but referenced by all storeys,
        through which it spans.</small>

    <p>
      The containment relationship of an element within a
      spatial structure has to be a hierarchical relationship, an
      element can only be contained within a single spatial
      structure element. The reference relationship between an
      element and the spatial structure may not be hierarchical,
      i.e. an element can reference many spatial structure
      elements.

<p><i>IfcGrid</i> ia a planar design
grid defined in 3D space used as an aid in locating structural and

is defined by a 3D coordinate system (and thereby the design grid

object placement of other products or grids. The XY plane of the 3D
coordinate system is used to place the grid axes, which are 2D
curves (for example, line, circle, trimmed curve, polyline, or composite
curve).</p>
<p>The inherited attributes <i>Name</i> and <i>Description</i> can

<p>The local placement for <i>IfcSite</i> is defined in its
supertype <i>IfcProduct</i>. It is defined by the
<i>IfcLocalPlacement</i>, which defines the local coordinate system
that is referenced by all geometric representations.</p>
<ul>

765;IfcElementQuantity;"<EPM-HTML>
<p><u>Definition from IAI</u>: An <i>IfcElementQuantity</i>
defines a set of derived measures of an element's physical
property. Elements could be spatial structure elements (like
buildings, storeys, or spaces) or building elements (like walls,
slabs, finishes). The <i>IfcElementQuantity</i> gets assigned to
the element by using the <i>IfcRelDefinesByProperties</i>
relationship.</p>
<p>The optional <i>MethodOfMeasurement</i> attribute defines the
code, e.g. from a standard method of measurement, which had been
used to calculate the element quantity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><small>NOTE The recognizable values for the name and the
method of measurement attributes have to be agreed upon in
further agreement documents, such as implementers agreements.
Some of these agreements might be limited to a certain region, to
which the method of measurement applies.</small></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The name attribute, given at the individual <i>Quantities</i>
provides a recognizable semantic meaning of the element quantity.
Both information is needed to establish a precise meaning for the
measure value. An optional description may be assigned to each of
the <i>Quantities</i>. All quantities assigned by a single
instance of <i>IfcElementQuantity</i> are deemed to have been
generated according to the same method of measurement. However
several instances of <i>IfcElementQuantity</i> are assignable to
an element, thus allowing for an element having quantities
generated according to several methods of measurement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><small>EXAMPLE1 To exchange the net floor area of spaces in
the German region (as <i>IfcSpace</i>), the name might be
'Netto-Grundfl&auml;che' (net floor area), and the method of
measurement might be accordingly 'DIN277-2' (German industry norm
no. 277 edition 2)</small></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><small>EXAMPLE2 The same instance of <i>IfcSpace</i> may have
a different area measure assigned in the German region according
to a housing regulation, the name would be 'Wohnfl&auml;che' and
the method of measurement would be '2.BV'. It would be attached
to the <i>IfcSpace</i> by a separate
<i>IfcRelDefinesByProperties</i> relationship.</small></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <i>IfcElementQuantity</i> can have the following subtypes
of <i>IfcPhysicalQuantity</i> within its SET of
<i>Quantities</i>, which count for the basis measure types
used:</p>
<ul>
<li>count measure</li>
<li>weight measure</li>
<li>length measure</li>
<li>area measure</li>
<li>volume measure</li>

<p>The decomposition relationship,
<i>IfcRelDecomposes</i>, defines the general concept of elements
being composed or decomposed. The decomposition relationship
denotes a whole/part hierarchy with the ability to navigate from
the whole (the composition) to the parts and vice versa.</p>
<p>Decompositions may be constrained by requiring both, the whole
and its parts, to be of the same type - thus establishing a
nesting relationship. Or they may require some form of physical
containment, thus establishing special types of aggregation
relationships.</p>
<blockquote><small>NOTE There are two special names for
decomposition, which are linguistically distinguished, nesting
and aggregation. The subtypes of <i>IfcRelDecomposes</i> will
introduce either the nesting or aggregation convention (see
<i>IfcRelNests</i> and
<i>IfcRelAggregates</i>).</small></blockquote>
<blockquote><small>EXAMPLE A cost element is a nest of other cost
elements. Or a structural frame is an aggregation of beams and
columns. Both are applications of decomposition
relationship.</small></blockquote>
<p>Decompositions imply a dependency, i.e. the definition of the
whole depends on the definition of the parts and the parts depend
on the existence of the whole. The decomposition relationship can
be applied in a recursive manner, i.e. a decomposed element can
be part in another decomposition. Cyclic references have to be

<p>The distribution element <i>IfcDistributionControlElement</i> defines occurrence elements of a building automation control system that are used to impart control over elements of a distribution system.</p>

<p>This class defines elements of a building automation control system. These are typically used to control distribution system elements to maintain  variables such as temperature, humidity, pressure, flow, power, or lighting levels, through the modulation, staging or sequencing of mechanical or electrical devices. The three general functional categories of control elements are as follows:</p>

<ul> 
<li>Impart control over flow control elements (<i>IfcFlowController</i>) in a distribution system such as dampers, valves, or relays, typically through the use of actuation (<i>IfcActuator</i>).</li>
<li>Sensing elements (<i>IfcSensor</i>) that measure changes in the controlled variable such as temperature, humidity, pressure, or flow.</li>
<li>Controllers (<i>IfcController</i>) typically classified according to the control action they seek to perform and generally responsible for making decisions about the elements under control.</li>
</ul>
    
<p>Since this class and its subtypes typically relate to many different distribution flow elements (<i>IfcDistributionFlowElement</i>), the objectified relationship <i>IfcRelFlowControlElements</i> has been provided to relate control and flow elements as required.</p>

1060;IfcDistributionPort;"<EPM-HTML>
 
<p>A distribution port is an inlet or outlet of a product through which a particular substance may flow.</p>
 
<p>Distribution ports are used for passage of solid, liquid, or gas substances, as well as electricity for power or communications.  Flow segments (pipes, ducts, cables) may be used to connect ports across products.  Distribution ports are defined by system type and flow direction such that for two ports to be connected, they must share the same system type and have opposite flow directions (one side being a <i>SOURCE</i> and the other being a <i>SINK</i>).  Ports are similar to openings in that they do not have any visible geometry; such geometry is captured at the shape representation of the enclosing element or element type.  Ports may have shape representations that indicate the position, orientation, and cross-section of the connection.</p>

<p><b><u>Assignment Use Definition</u></b>:</p>

<p>For the most common case of an <i>IfcDistributionElement</i> subtype containing ports of a particular <i>PredefinedType</i> that all belong to the same distribution system, the <i>IfcDistributionElement</i> is assigned to the <i>IfcDistributionSystem</i> via the <i>IfcRelAssignsToGroup</i> relationship, where <i>IfcDistributionPort</i>'s are implied as part of the corresponding system based on their <i>PredefinedType</i>.  An <i>IfcDistributionElement</i> may belong to multiple systems, however only one <i>IfcDistributionSystem</i> of a particular <i>PredefinedType</i>.</p>

<p>For rare cases where an <i>IfcDistributionElement</i> subtype contains ports of the same <i>PredefinedType</i> yet different ports belong to different systems, alternatively each <i>IfcDistributionPort</i> may be directly assigned to a single <i>IfcDistributionSystem</i> via the <i>IfcRelAssignsToGroup</i> relationship, where the <i>PredefinedType</i> must match.  Such assignment indicates that the <i>IfcDistributionSystem</i> assigned from the <i>IfcDistributionPort</i> overrides any such system of the same <i>PredefinedType</i> assigned from the containing <i>IfcDistributionElement</i>, if any.</p>

<p>Additionally, an <i>IfcDistributionSystem</i> may in turn be assigned to an <i>IfcDistributionPort</i> indicating the host or origination of the system using <i>IfcRelAssignsToProduct</i>.</p>

For elements containing directional ports (<i>IfcDistributionPort</i> with <i>FlowDirection</i> of <i>SOURCE</i> or <i>SINK</i>), the direction of the curve indicates direction of flow where a <i>SINK</i> port is positioned at the start of the curve and a <i>SOURCE</i> port is positioned at the end of the curve.  This representation is most applicable to flow segments (pipes, ducts, cables), however may be used at other elements to define a primary flow path if applicable.</li> 

<li><b>'Footprint'</b>: Represents the 2D footprint outline of the item having <i>IfcShapeRepresentation.RepresentationType</i> of  'GeometricCurveSet' and containing a single <i>IfcGeometricCurveSet</i> consisting of one or more <i>IfcCurve</i> subtypes such as <i>IfcPolyline</i>, <i>IfcTrimmedCurve</i>, <i>IfcCompositeCurve</i>, or <i>IfcCircle</i>.</li>

<li><b>'Body'</b>: Represents the 3D shape of the item having <i>IfcShapeRepresentation.RepresentationType</i> of 'SurfaceModel', 'SolidModel', or any solid model specializations including 'Brep', 'AdvancedBrep', 'SweptSolid', 'AdvancedSweptSolid', 'CSG', 'Clipping', or 'SectionedSpine').</li>

<li><b>'Clearance'</b>: Represents the 3D clearance volume of the item having <i>RepresentationType</i> of 'Surface3D'.  Such clearance region indicates space that should not intersect with the 'Body' representation of other elements, though may intersect with the 'Clearance' representation of other elements.  The particular use of clearance space may be for safety, maintenance, or other purpose.</li>

<li><b>'Lighting'</b>: Represents the light emission of the item having <i>IfcShapeRepresentation.RepresentationType</i> of 'LightSource' and containing one or more <i>IfcLightSource</i> subtypes.  This representation is most applicable to lamps and light fixtures, however may be used at other elements that emit light.
</ul>

<p>For all representations, if a <i>IfcDistributionFlowElement</i> occurrence is defined by a <i>IfcDistributionFlowElementType</i> having a representation of the same identifier, then 'MappedRepresentation' should be used at the occurrence unless overridden.</p>

<p>If materials are defined, geometry of each representation (most typically the 'Body' representation) may be organized into shape aspects where styles may be derived by correlating <i>IfcShapeAspect.Name</i> to a corresponding material (<i>IfcMaterialConstituent.Name</i> or <i>IfcMaterialProfile.Name</i>).</p>

<p>Representations are further defined at subtypes; for example, parametric flow segments align material profiles with the 'Axis' representation.</p>

<P>
An element component is a representation for minor items included in, added to or connecting to or between
   elements, which usually are not of interest from the overall building structure viewpoint.
   However, these small parts may have vital and load carrying functions within the construction.
   These items do not provide any actual space boundaries.
   Typical examples of <I>IfcElementComponent</I>s include different kinds of fasteners and various accessories.
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE class=""history"">HISTORY New entity in IFC Release 2x2</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p>It is often desirable to model a number of same-shaped element components by means of a single
occurrence object, e.g. several bolts within a connection or a row of reinforcement elements.
In this IFC release, this is possible by means of multiple mapped representation as documented below.</p>

<p>To express the multiplicity of element components also on a higher semantic level,
an <i>IfcElementQuantity</i> should be provided via <i>IfcRelDefinesByProperties</i>.
The quantity should contain an <i>IfcQuantityCount</i> named 'Count' with the number of components.</p>

<P><B><U>Geometry Use Definition</U></B></P>

<P>
  The geometric representation of <I>IfcElementComponent</I> is given by the <I>IfcProductDefinitionShape</I>,
  allowing multiple geometric representations. Included are:
</P>

<P><B>Local Placement</B><BR>
  The local placement for <I>IfcElementComponent</I> is defined in its supertype <I>IfcProduct</I>.
  It is defined by the <I>IfcLocalPlacement</I>, which defines the local coordinate system that is
  referenced by all geometric representations. 
</P>

<UL>
  <LI>The <I>PlacementRelTo</I> relationship of <I>IfcLocalPlacement</I> shall point (if given) to
      the local placement of the same <I>IfcElement</I> or <I>IfcElementAssembly</I>, which is
      used in the <I>Decomposes</I> inverse attribute, i.e. the local placement is defined relative to
      the local placement of the element or element assembly in which the component is contained. 
  <LI>If the relative placement is not used, the absolute placement is defined within the world coordinate system. 
</UL>

<P><B>Surface Model Representation</B></P>
<P>
  Any <I>IfcElementComponent</I> (if no further constraints are defined at the level of its subtypes)
  may be represented as a single or multiple surface models, based on either shell or face based models.
  The following attribute values for the <I>IfcShapeRepresentation</I> holding this geometric representation
  shall be used:
</P>
<UL>
  <LI><I>RepresentationIdentifier</I> : 'Body'</LI>
  <LI><I>RepresentationType</I> : 'SurfaceModel'</LI>
</UL>

<P>
<B>Brep Representation</B></P>
<P>
  Any <I>IfcElementComponent</I> (if no further constraints are defined at the level of its subtypes)
  may be represented as a single or multiple Boundary Representation elements (which are restricted to faceted
  Brep with or without voids). The Brep representation allows for the representation of complex element shape.
  The following attribute values for the <I>IfcShapeRepresentation</I> holding this geometric representation
  shall be used:
</P>
<UL>
  <LI><I>RepresentationIdentifier</I> : 'Body'</LI>
  <LI><I>RepresentationType</I> : 'Brep'</LI>
</UL>

<P><B>Mapped Representation</B></P>
<P>
  The mapped item, <I>IfcMappedItem</I>, should be used if appropriate as it allows for reusing the geometry
  definition of a type at occurrences of the same type.
  The following attribute values for the <I>IfcShapeRepresentation</I> holding this geometric representation
  shall be used:
</P>
<UL>
  <LI><I>RepresentationIdentifier</I> : 'Body'</LI>
  <LI><I>RepresentationType</I> : 'MappedRepresentation'</LI>
</UL>

<p><b>Multiple Mapped Representation</b></p>

<p>A single instance of a subtype of <i>IfcElementComponent</i> can stand for several
actual element components at once.  In this case, the <i>IfcShapeRepresentation</i>
contains as many mapped items as there are element components combined within this
occurrence object:</p>

<tr><td><p class=""figure"">Figure 151 &mdash; Element component mapped representation</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p>Representation identifier and type are the same as in single mapped representation.
The number of mapped items in the representation corresponds with the count of
element components in the <i>IfcElementQuantity</i>.</p>

<p><u>Definition from ISO 6707-1:1989</u>: Structural member designed to carry loads between or beyond points of support, usually narrow in relation to its length and horizontal or nearly so.</p>

<p>An <i>IfcBeam</i> is a horizontal, or nearly horizontal, structural member that is capable of withstanding load primarily by resisting bending. It represents such a member from an architectural point of view. It is not required to be load bearing.</p>

<blockquote class=""note"">NOTE &nbsp;The representation of a beam in a structural analysis model is provided by
<i>IfcStructuralCurveMember</i> being part of an <i>IfcStructuralAnalysisModel</i>.</blockquote>

<blockquote class=""note"">NOTE &nbsp;For any longitudial structural member, not constrained to be predominately horizontal nor vertical, or where this semantic information is irrelevant, the entity <i>IfcMember</i> should be used.</blockquote>

<p>The IFC specification provides two entities for beam occurrences:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>IfcBeamStandardCase</i> used for all occurrences of beams, that have a profile defined that is swept along a directrix. The profile might be changed uniformly by a taper definition along the directrix. The profile parameter and its cardinal point of insertion can be fully described by the <i>IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage</i>. These beams are always represented geometricly by an 'Axis' and a 'SweptSolid' or 'AdvancedSweptSolid' shape representation (or by a 'Clipping' geometry based on the swept solid), if a 3D geometric representation is assigned. In addition they have to have a corresponding <i>IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage</i> assigned.
<blockquote class=""note"">NOTE&nbsp; View definitions and implementer agreements may further constrain the applicable geometry types, for example, by excluding tapering from an <i>IfcBeamStandardCase</i> implementation.</blockquote>
</li>
<li><i>IfcBeam</i> used for all other occurrences of beams, particularly for beams with changing profile sizes along the extrusion, or beams defined by non-linear extrusion, or beams having only 'Brep', or 'SurfaceModel' geometry.</li>
</ul>

establish the common&nbsp;type name, usage (or predefined) type,
common material layer set, common set of properties and common
shape representations (using <i>IfcRepresentationMap</i>). The
<i>IfcBeamType</i> is attached using the
<i>IfcRelDefinedByType.RelatingType</i> objectified relationship
and is accessible by the inverse <i><font color=
""#0000FF"">IsTypedBy</font></i> attribute.</p>
<p>If no <i>IfcBeamType</i> is attached (i.e. if only occurrence
information is given) the <i>PredefinedType</i> should be provided.
If set to .USERDEFINED. a user defined value can be provided by the

<p><u><b>Containment Use Definition</b></u></p>
<p>The <i>IfcBeam</i>, as any subtype of <i>IfcBuildingElement</i>,
may participate in two different containment relationships. The
first (and in most implementation scenarios mandatory) relationship
is the hierachical spatial containment, the second (optional)
relationship is the aggregation within an element assembly.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <i>IfcBeam</i> is places within the project spatial
hierarchy using the objectified relationship
<i>IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure</i>, refering to it by its
inverse attribute <i>SELF\IfcElement.ContainedInStructure</i>.
Subtypes of <i>IfcSpatialStructureElement</i> are valid spatial
containers, with <i>IfcBuildingStorey</i> being the default
container.</li>
<li>The <i>IfcBeam</i> may be aggregated into an element assembly
using the objectified relationship <i>IfcRelAggregates</i>,
refering to it by its inverse attribute
<i>SELF\IfcObjectDefinition.Decomposes</i>. Any subtype of
<i>IfcElement</i> can be an element assembly, with
<i>IfcElementAssembly</i> as a special focus subtype. In this case
it should not be additionally contained in the project spatial
hierarchy, i.e. <i>SELF\IfcElement.ContainedInStructure</i> should
be <i>NIL.</i></li>

<p><u>Definition from ISO 6707-1:1989</u>: Structural member of
slender form, usually vertical, that transmits to its base the
forces, primarily in compression, that are applied to it.</p>
<p><An <i>IfcColumn</i> is a vertical
structural member which often is aligned with a structural grid
intersection. It represents a vertical, or nearly vertical,
structural member that transmits, through compression, the weight
of the structure above to other structural elements below. It
represents such a member from an architectural point of view. It
is not required to be load bearing.</p>
<blockquote><small>NOTE The representation of a column in a
structural analysis model is provided by
<i>IfcStructuralCurveMember</i> being part of an
<i>IfcStructuralAnalysisModel</i>.</small><br>
<br>
<small>NOTE ÿFor any longitudial structural member, not
constrained to be predominately horizontal nor vertical, or where
this semantic information is irrelevant, the entity
<i>IfcMember</i> exists.</small></blockquote>
<p>The IFC specification provides two entities for column
occurrences:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>IfcColumnStandardCase</i> used for all occurrences of
columns, tthat have a profile defined that is swept along a
directrix. The profile might be changed uniformly by a taper
definition along the directrix. The profile parameter and its
cardinal point of insertion can be fully described by the
<i>IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage</i>. These beams are always
represented geometricly by an 'Axis' and a 'SweptSolid' or
'AdvancedSweptSolid' shape representation (or by a 'Clipping'
geometry based on the swept solid), if a 3D geometric
representation is assigned. In addition they have to have a
corresponding <i>IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage</i> assigned.
<blockquote><small>NOTEÿ View definitions and implementer
agreements may further constrain the applicable geometry types,
e.g. by excluding tapering from an <i>IfcColumnStandardCase</i>
implementation.</small></blockquote>
</li>
<li><i>IfcColumn</i> used for all other occurrences of columns,

containers, with <i>IfcBuildingStorey</i> being the default
container.</li>
<li>The <i>IfcColumn</i>, may be aggregated into an element
assembly using the objectified relationship

<p>An <i>IfcMember</i> is a
structural member designed to carry loads between or beyond
points of support. It is not required to be load bearing. The
orientation of the member (being horizontal, vertical or sloped)
is not relevant to its definition (in contrary to <i>IfcBeam</i>
and <i>IfcColumn</i>). An <i>IfcMember</i> represents a linear
structural element from an architectural or structural modeling
point of view and shall be used if it cannot be expressed more
specifically as either an <i>IfcBeam</i> or an
<i>IfcColumn</i>.</p>
<blockquote><small>NOTE The representation of a member in a
structural analysis model is provided by
<i>IfcStructuralCurveMember</i> being part of an
<i>IfcStructuralAnalysisModel</i>.</small></blockquote>
<p>The IFC specification provides two entities for member
occurrences:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>IfcMemberStandardCase</i> used for all occurrences of
members, that have a profile defined that is swept along a
directrix. The profile might be changed uniformly by a taper
definition along the directrix. The profile parameter and its
cardinal point of insertion can be fully described by the
<i>IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage</i>. These beams are always
represented geometricly by an 'Axis' and a 'SweptSolid' or
'AdvancedSweptSolid' shape representation (or by a 'Clipping'
geometry based on the swept solid), if a 3D geometric
representation is assigned. In addition they have to have a
corresponding <i>IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage</i> assigned.
<blockquote><small>NOTEÿ View definitions and implementer
agreements may further constrain the applicable geometry types,
e.g. by excluding tapering from an <i>IfcMemberStandardCase</i>
implementation.</small></blockquote>
</li>
<li><i>IfcMember</i> used for all other occurrences of members,
particularly for members with changing profile sizes along the
extrusion, or members defined by non-linear extrusion, or members
having only 'Brep', or 'SurfaceModel' geometry.</li>

geometrically by an 'Axis' and a 'SweptSolid' shape
representation (or by a 'Clipping' geometry based on
'SweptSolid'), if a 3D geometric representation is assigned. In

<p>The <i>IfcWall</i> (and the subtype

containment relationships. The first (and in most implementation
scenarios mandatory) relationship is the hierarchical spatial
containment, the second (optional) relationship is the
aggregation within anÿelement assembly.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <i>IfcWall</i> is places within the project spatial
hierarchy using the objectified relationship
<i>IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure</i>, referring to it by its
inverse attribute <i>SELF\IfcElement.ContainedInStructure</i>.
Subtypes ofÿ<i>IfcSpatialStructureElement</i> are valid spatial
containers, with <i>IfcBuildingStorey</i> being the default
container.</li>
<li>Theÿ<i>IfcWall</i> may be aggregated into an element assembly
using the objectified relationship <i>IfcRelAggregates</i>,
referring to it by its inverse attribute
<i>SELF\IfcObjectDefinition.Decomposes</i>. Any subtype of
<i>IfcElement</i> can be an element assembly, with
<i>IfcElementAssembly</i> as a special focus subtype.<br>
In this case the wall should not be additionally contained in the
project spatial hierarchy,
i.e.ÿ<i>SELF\IfcElement.ContainedInStructure</i> should be
<i>NIL.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Theÿ<i>IfcWallÿ</i>may also be an aggregate i.e. being
composed by other elements and acting as an assembly using the
objectified relationship <i>IfcRelAggregates</i>, referring to it
by its inverse attribute
<i>SELF\IfcObjectDefinition.IsDecomposedBy</i>. Components of a
wall are described by instances of <i>IfcBuildingElementPart</i>
that are aggregated to form a complex wall.<br>
In this case, the containedÿ<i>IfcBuildingElementPart</i>'s
should not be additionally contained in the project spatial
hierarchy, i.e. the inverse attribute
<i>SELF\IfcElement.ContainedInStructure</i> of
<i>IfcBuildingElementPart</i> should be <i>NIL.</i></p>

1318;IfcSlab;"<EPM-HTML> 
<p>A slab is a component of the
construction that normally encloses a space vertically. The slab
may provide the lower support (floor) or upper construction (roof
slab) in any space in a building. It shall be noted, that only
the core or constructional part of this construction is
considered to be a slap. The upper finish (flooring, roofing) and
the lower finish (ceiling, suspended ceiling) are considered to
be coverings. A special type of slab is the landing, described as
a floor section to which one or more stair flights or ramp
flights connect.</p>
<blockquote><small>NOTE There is a representation of slabs for
structural analysis provided by a proper subtype of
<i>IfcStructuralMember</i> being part of the
<i>IfcStructuralAnalysisModel</i>.</small><br>
<br>
<small>NOTE ÿAn arbitrary planar element to which this semantic
information is not applicable or irrelevant shall be modeled as
<i>IfcPlate</i>.</small></blockquote>
<p>A slab may have openings, such as floor openings, or recesses.
They are defined by an <i>IfcOpeningElement</i> attached to the
slab using the inverse relationship <i>HasOpenings</i> pointing
to <i>IfcRelVoidsElement</i>.</p>
<p>The IFC specification provides three entities for slab
occurrences:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>IfcSlabStandardCase</i> used for all occurrences of slabs,
that are prismatic and where the thickness parameter can be fully
described by the <i>IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage</i>. These slabs are
always represented geometrically by a 'SweptSolid' geometry (or
by a 'Clipping' geometry based on 'SweptSolid'), if a 3D
geometric representation is assigned. In addition they have to
have a corresponding <i>IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage</i>
assigned.</li>
<li><i>IfcSlabElementedCase</i> used for occurrences of slabs
which are aggregated from subordinate elements, following
specific decomposition rules expressed by the mandatory use of
<i>IfcRelAggregates</i> relationship.</li>
<li><i>IfcSlab</i> used for all other occurrences of slabs,
particularly for slabs with changing thickness, or slabs with non
planar surfaces, and slabs having only 'SweptSolid' or 'Brep'
geometry.</li>

<p>The <i>IfcSlab</i>, as any subtype of

<ul>
<li>Theÿ<i>IfcSlab</i> is places within the project spatial
hierarchy using the objectified relationship
<i>IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure</i>, referring to it by its
inverse attribute <i>SELF\IfcElement.ContainedInStructure</i>.
Subtypes ofÿ<i>IfcSpatialStructureElement</i> are valid spatial
containers, with <i>IfcBuildingStorey</i> being the default
container.</li>
<li>Theÿ<i>IfcSlab</i> may be aggregated into an element assembly
using the objectified relationship <i>IfcRelAggregates</i>,
referring to it by its inverse attribute
<i>SELF\IfcObjectDefinition.Decomposes</i>. Any subtype of
<i>IfcElement</i> can be an element assembly, with
<i>IfcElementAssembly</i> as a special focus subtype.<br>
In this case it should not be additionally contained in the
project spatial hierarchy,
i.e.ÿ<i>SELF\IfcElement.ContainedInStructure</i> should be
<i>NIL.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>The <i>IfcSlab</i><i>ÿ</i>may also be an aggregate i.e. being
composed by other elements and acting as an assembly using the
objectified relationship <i>IfcRelAggregates</i>, referring to it
by its inverse attribute
<i>SELF\IfcObjectDefinition.IsDecomposedBy</i>. Components of a
slab are described by instances of subtypes of
<i>IfcBuildingElement</i>, with <i>IfcBuildingElementPart</i> as
a special focus subtype that are aggregated to form a complex
slab. In this case, the contained elements should not be
additionally contained in the project spatial hierarchy, i.e. the
inverse attribute <i>SELF\IfcElement.ContainedInStructure</i> of
<i>IfcBuildingElementPart</i> (or other subtypes of
<i>IfcBuildingElement</i>) should be <i>NIL.</i></p>

<p><u><b>Containment Use Definition</b></u></p>
<p>The <i>IfcDoor</i>, as any subtype of

containment, the second (optional) relationship is the
aggregation within anÿelement assembly.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <i>IfcDoor</i> is places within the project spatial
hierarchy using the objectified relationship
<i>IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure</i>, refering to it by its
inverse attribute <i>SELF\IfcElement.ContainedInStructure</i>.
Subtypes ofÿ<i>IfcSpatialStructureElement</i> are valid spatial
containers, with <i>IfcBuildingStorey</i> being the default
container.</li>
<li>The <i>IfcDoor</i> may be aggregated into an element assembly
using the objectified relationship <i>IfcRelAggregates</i>,
refering to it by its inverse attribute
<i>SELF\IfcObjectDefinition.Decomposes</i>. Doors may be part of
an <i>IfcCurtainWall</i> as a special focus subtype. In this case
it should not be additionally contained in the project spatial
hierarchy, i.e.ÿ<i>SELF\IfcElement.ContainedInStructure</i>
should be <i>NIL.</i></li>
</ul>

<small>NOTE The containment shall be defined independently of the

filling of an opening established by <i>IfcRelFillsElement</i>,
it is also contained in the spatial structure by an

<p><u><b>Geometry Use Definitions</b></u>:</p>
<p>The geometric representation of <i>IfcDoor</i> is given by the
<i>IfcProductDefinitionShape</i>, allowing multiple geometric
representations. The <i>IfcDoor</i>, in case of an occurrance
object, gets its parameter and shape from the <i>IfcDoorType</i>.
If an <i>IfcRepresentationMap</i> (a block definition) is defined
for the <i>IfcDoorType</i>, then the <i>IfcDoor</i> inserts it
through the <i>IfcMappedItem</i>.</p>
<p><b>Local Placement</b></p>
<p>The local placement for <i>IfcDoor</i> is defined in its
supertype <i>IfcProduct</i>. It is defined by the
<i>IfcLocalPlacement</i>, which defines the local coordinate
system that is referenced by all geometric representations.</p>
<ol>
<li>The <i>PlacementRelTo</i> relationship of
<i>IfcLocalPlacement</i> shall point to the local placement of
the same element (if given), in which the <i>IfcDoor</i> is used
as a filling (normally an <i>IfcOpeningElement</i>), as provided
by the <i>IfcRelFillsElement</i> relationship.</li>
<li>If the <i>IfcDoor</i> is not inserted into an
<i>IfcOpeningElement</i>, then the <i>PlacementRelTo</i>
relationship of <i>IfcLocalPlacement</i> shall point (if given)
to the local placement of the same
<i>IfcSpatialStructureElement</i> that is used in the
<i>ContainedInStructure</i> inverse attribute or to a referenced
spatial structure element at a higher level.</li>
<li>If the relative placement is not used, the absolute placement
is defined within the world coordinate system.</li>
</ol>
<p><b><i>Geometric Representation</i></b></p>
<p>Theÿgeometric representation of <i>IfcDoor</i> is defined
using the following (potentiallyÿmultiple)
<i>IfcShapeRepresentation</i>'s for its
<i>IfcProductDefinitionShape</i>:</p>
<ul>
<li><u>Profile</u>: Aÿ<font color=""#0000FF"">'Curve3D'</font>
consisting of a single losed curve defining the outer boundary of
the door (lining). The door parametric representation uses this
profile in order to apply the door lining and panel parameter. If
not provided, the profile of the <i>IfcOpeningElement</i> is
taken.</li>
<li><u>FootPrint</u>: A 'GeometricCurveSet', or 'Annotation2D'
representation defining the 2D shape of the door</li>
<li><u>Body</u>: A 'SweptSolid', 'SurfaceModel', or 'Brep'
representation defining the 3D shape of the door.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition the parametric representation of a (limited) door
shape is available by applying the parameters from
<i>IfcDoorType</i> referencing <i>IfcDoorLiningProperties</i> and
<i>IfcDoorPanelProperties</i>. The purpose of the parameter is
described at those entities and below (door opening operation by
door type).</p>
<p><b>Profile -ÿ'Curve3D' representation</b></p>
<p>The door profile is represented by a three-dimensional closed
curve within a particular shape representation. The profile is
used to apply the parameter of the parametric door
representation.ÿThe following attribute values for the
<i>IfcShapeRepresentation</i> holding this geometric
representation shall be used:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>RepresentationIdentifier</i> : 'Profile'</li>
<li><i>RepresentationType</i> : 'Curve3D', only a single closed
curve shall be contained in the set of
<i>IfcShapeRepresentation.Items</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p>A 'Profile' representation has to be provided if:</p>
<ul>
<li>a parametric representation shall be applied to the door
AND</li>
<li style=""list-style: none"">
<ul>
<li>theÿdoor is 'free standing', or</li>
<li>the opening into which theÿdoor is inserted is not extruded
horizontally (i.e. where the opening profile does not match
theÿdoor profile)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>FootPrint -ÿ'GeometricCurveSet' or 'Annotation2D'
representation</b></p>
<p>The door foot print is represented by a set of
two-dimensionalÿcurves (or in case of 'Annotation2D' additional
hatching and text) within a particular shape representation. The
foot print is used for the planview representation of the
door.ÿThe following attribute values for the

representation shall be used:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>RepresentationIdentifier</i> : 'FootPrint'</li>
<li><i>RepresentationType</i> : 'GeometricCurveSet', or
'Annotation2D'</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Body - 'SweptSolid', 'SurfaceModel', or 'Brep'
representation</b></p>
<p>The door body is either represented parameterically (see
parametric representation) or by explicit 3D shape. The 3D shape
is given by using extrusion geometry, or surface models, or Brep
models within a particular shape representation. The body is used
for the model view representation of the door.ÿThe following
attribute values for the <i>IfcShapeRepresentation</i> holding
this geometric representation shall be used:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>RepresentationIdentifier</i> : 'Body'</li>
<li><i>RepresentationType</i> : 'SweptSolid', 'SurfaceModel', or

</ul>
<p><b>MappedRepresentation</b></p>
<p>The 'FootPrint' and 'Body' geometric representation of
<i>IfcDoor</i> can be shared among several identical doors using
the 'MappedRepresentation'. The following attribute values for
the <i>IfcShapeRepresentation</i> holding this geometric
representation shall be used:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>RepresentationIdentifier</i> : 'FootPrint', 'Body'</li>
<li><i>RepresentationType</i> : 'MappedRepresentation'</li>
</ul>
<p>The same constraints, as given for theÿ 'FootPrint', 'Body'
representation identifiers, shall apply to the
<i>MappedRepresentation</i> of the
<i>IfcRepresentationMap</i>.</p>
<p><u><b>Parameteric Representation using parameters at

<p>The parameters that defines the shape of the <i>IfcDoor</i>,
are given at the <i>IfcDoorType</i> and the property sets, which

defines the local placement which determines the opening
direction of the door. <font color=""#0000FF"">The overall size of
the <i>IfcDoor</i> to be used to apply the lining or panel
parameter provided by the <i>IfcDoorType</i> is determined by the

<i>IfcOpeningElement</i> using the <i>IfcRelFillsElement</i>
relatioship, having a horizontal extrusion (along the y-axis of
the <i>IfcDoor</i>), the overall size is determined by the
extrusion profile of the <i>IfcOpeningElement</i>.</font></p>
<blockquote><small>NOTE ÿThe <i>OverallWidth</i> and

<p><u><b>Geometry Use Definitions</b></u>:</p>
<p>The geometric representation of <i>IfcWindow</i> is given by
the <i>IfcProductDefinitionShape</i>, allowing multiple geometric

object, gets its parameter and shape from the
<i>IfcWindowType</i>. If an <i>IfcRepresentationMap</i> (a block

<i>IfcWindow</i> inserts it through the <i>IfcMappedItem</i>
(refered to by <i>IfcShapeRepresentation.Items</i>).</p>
<p><b>Local Placement</b></p>
<p>The local placement for <i>IfcWindow</i> is defined in its
supertype <i>IfcProduct</i>. It is defined by the

spatial structure element at a higher level.</li>
<li>If the relative placement is not used, the absolute placement
is defined within the world coordinate system.</li>
</ol>
<p><b><i>Geometric Representation</i></b></p>
<p>Theÿgeometric representation of <i>IfcWindow</i> is defined
using the following (potentiallyÿmultiple)

<ul>
<li><u>Profile</u>: Aÿ<font color=""#0000FF"">'Curve3D'</font>

<p><u>Definition from IAI</u>: An <i>IfcPlate</i> is a planar and
often flat part with constant thickness. A plate can be a
structural part carrying loads between or beyond points of
support, however it is not required to be load bearing.ÿThe
location of the plate (being horizontal, vertical or sloped) is
not relevant to its definition (in contrary to <i>IfcWall</i> and
<i>IfcSlab</i> (as floor slab)).ÿ</p>
<blockquote><small>NOTE ÿPlates areÿnormally made of steel, other
metallic material, or by glass panels. However the definition of
<i>IfcPlate</i> is material independent and specific material
information shall be handled by using
<i>IfcAssociatesMaterial</i> to assign a material specification
to the <i>IfcPlate</i>.ÿ</small><br>
<br>
<small>NOTE ÿAlthough not necessarily, plates are often add-on
parts. This is represented by the <i>IfcRelAggregates</i>
decomposition mechanism used to aggregate parts, such as
<i>IfcPlate</i>, into a container element, e.g.
<i>IfcElementAssembly</i>, or <i>IfcCurtainWall</i>.ÿ</small><br>
<br>
<small>NOTE The representation of a plate in a structural
analysis model is provided by <i>IfcStructuralSurfaceMember</i>
being part of an
<i>IfcStructuralAnalysisModel</i>.</small></blockquote>
<p>An instance <i>IfcPlate</i> should preferably get its
geometric representation and material assignment through the type
definition by <i>IfcPlateType</i> assigned using the
<i>IfcRelDefinesByType</i> relationship. This allows identical
plates in a construction to be represented by the same instance
of <i>IfcPlateType</i>.</p>
<p>A plate may have openings, such as voids or recesses. They are
defined by an <i>IfcOpeningElement</i> attached to the plate
using the inverse relationship <i>HasOpenings</i> pointing to
<i>IfcRelVoidsElement</i>. The position number of a plate as
often used in steel construction is assigned through the
attribute <i>IfcElement.Tag</i></p>
<p>The IFC specification provides two entities for plate
occurrences:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>IfcPlateStandardCase</i> used for all occurrences of
plates, that are prismatic and where the thickness parameter can
be fully described by the <i>IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage</i>. These
plates are always represented geometrically by a 'SweptSolid'
geometry (or by a 'Clipping' geometry based on 'SweptSolid'), if
a 3D geometric representation is assigned. In addition they have
to have a corresponding <i>IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage</i>
assigned.</li>
<li><i>IfcPlate</i> used for all other occurrences of plates,
particularly for plates with changing thickness, or plates with
non planar surfaces, and plates having only 'SurfaceModel' or

<blockquote class=""note"">NOTE <i>LiningDepth</i> describes the length of the lining along the reveal of the door opening. It can be given by an absolute value if the door lining has a specific depth depending on the door style. However often it is equal to the wall thickness. If the same door style is used (like the same type of single swing door), but inserted into different walls with different thicknesses, it would be necessary to create a special door style for each wall thickness. Therefore several CAD systems allow to set the value to ""automatically aligned"" to wall thickness. This should be exchanged by leaving the optional attribute LiningDepth unassigned.

<p><b>IfcUnitaryControlElement</b> defines the occurrence of any unitary control element; common information about unitary control element types is handled by <i>IfcUnitaryControlElementType</i>. 
The <i>IfcUnitaryControlElementType</i> (if present) may establish the common type name, usage (predefined type), properties, materials, ports, composition, assignments, and representations. 
The <i>IfcUnitaryControlElementType</i> is attached using the <i>IfcRelDefinesByType</i> objectified relationship and is accessible by the <i>IsTypedBy</i> inverse attribute. 
If the <i>IfcUnitaryControlElementType</i> has ports or aggregated elements, such objects are reflected at the <b>IfcUnitaryControlElement</b> occurrence using the <i>IfcRelDefinesByObject</i> relationship.</p>

It defines the relation between structural members and connections with structural activities (actions and reactions).</p>

<p>Relationships between elements in the building model and structural items as their idealizations can be expressed by instances of <i>IfcRelAssignsToProduct</i>.</p>

<p><b><u>Coordinate Systems</u></b>:</p>

<p>The following coordinate systems are distinguished:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The so-called global coordinate system is the coordinate system shared by all items and activities which are grouped in a common <i>IfcStructuralAnalysisModel</i>.  This coordinate system is established by <i>SELF\IfcProduct.ObjectPlacement</i>.  (This coordinate system is not necessarily the same as the <i>IfcProject</i>'s world coordinate system.)</li>
  <li>The so-called local coordinate system is a coordinate system local to a structural item (connection or member).  This coordinate system is established by a <i>Representation</i> (attribute inherited from <i>IfcProduct</i>) in conjunction with further use definitions and attributes of subtypes of <i>IfcStructuralItem</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Representation items in topology representations are always given within the <i>ObjectPlacement</i>, i.e. in so-called global coordinates (global with respect to the <i>IfcStructuralAnalysisModel</i> to which this item belongs).</i>

<p>The usage of local coordinate systems is further defined in subtypes.</p>

<p><b><u>Topology Use Definitions</u></b>:</p>

<p>Instances of <i>IfcStructuralItem</i> shall have a topology representation.  It includes a placement and a product representation. The <i>IfcProductRepresentation</i> shall be given by an item in a <i>Representation</i> of type <i>IfcTopologyRepresentation</i>.</p>

<p><b>Local Placement</b></p>

<p>The local placement for <i>IfcStructuralActivity</i> is defined in its supertype <I>IfcProduct</I>.  It is defined by the <i>IfcLocalPlacement</i>, which establishes a global coordinate system which shall be common to all items and activities in an <i>IfcStructuralAnalysisModel</i>.</p>

<p><b>Topology Representation</b></p>

<p>Instances of <i>IfcStructuralItem</i> shall have a topology representation given by an instance of a subtype of <i>IfcTopologicalRepresentationItem</i>, which should be the single item of <i>IfcTopologyRepresentation.Items</i>.  Depending on the dimensionality of the structural item, one of the following types of toplogical representation items shall be used:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Point connections shall be represented by an <i>IfcVertexPoint</i> with an underlying <i>IfcCartesianPoint</i>.
      The Cartesian point is the reference point of the connection in the so-called global coordinate system.
      The following labels are used in the <i>IfcTopologyRepresentation</i>:
      <ul>
        <li><i>RepresentationIdentifier</i>: 'Reference'</li>
        <li><i>RepresentationType</i>: 'Vertex'</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      </li>

  <li>Curve members and curve connections shall either be represented by an <i>IfcOrientedEdge</i>,
      <i>IfcEdgeCurve</i>, or <i>IfcEdge</i>.  The curve to which the <i>IfcEdgeCurve</i> (or an
      <i>IfcOrientedEdge</i>'s underlying <i>IfcEdgeCurve</i>) refers to is the reference curve of the structural
      item in the global coordinate system.  Start and end vertex of the edge shall be <i>IfcVertexPoint</i>s
      with underlying <i>IfcCartesianPoint</i>s.
      The following labels are used in the <i>IfcTopologyRepresentation</i>:
      <ul>
        <li><i>RepresentationIdentifier</i>: 'Reference'</li>
        <li><i>RepresentationType</i>: 'Edge'</li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote><font size=""-1"">NOTE&nbsp; While an <i>IfcEdge</i> (or <i>IfcOrientedEdge</i> with underlying
      <i>IfcEdge</i>) does not provide an explicit underlying curve geometry, it may be used to imply an
      underlying straight line as reference curve with the origin of the curve parameter at the start vertex
      point.</font></blockquote>
      </li>

  <li>Surface members and surface connections shall be represented by an <i>IfcFaceSurface</i>.
      The underlying surface defeines the reference surface of the structural surface item in the global
      coordiante system.  All edges in the bounds of the face shall conform to the rules for edge
      representations of structural curve item.
      The following labels are used in the <i>IfcTopologyRepresentation</i>:
      <ul>
        <li><i>RepresentationIdentifier</i>: 'Reference'</li>
        <li><i>RepresentationType</i>: 'Face'</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
</ul>

<p>The reference point, reference curve, or reference surface partially or completely defines the local coordinate system of the represented structural item according to the following rules.  In all cases, The local x,y,z directions form a right-handed Cartesian coordinate system.</p>

<p><i>Structural point items</i></p>

<ul>
  <li>The reference point in the representation is the origin of the local coordinate system of the structural item.</li>
  <li>The axes of the local coordiante system are either parallel with and directed like the so-called global coordinate axes, or are oriented according to definitions at the respective subtype of <i>IfcStructuralItem</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Structural curve items</i></p>

<ul>
  <li>The u parameter origin of the reference curve in the representation is the origin of the local coordinate system of the structural item.</li>
  <li>The local x axis is parallel with the tangent on the curve and directed like the u parameter direction.</li>
  <li>The local y and z axes are oriented according to definitions at the respective subtypes of <i>IfcStructuralItem</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Structural surface items</i></p>

<ul>
  <li>The u,v parameter origin of the reference surface in the representation is the origin of the local coordinate system of the structural item.</li>
  <li>The local x and y directions follow the tangents on the surface and are in parallel with and directed like u and v respectively.</li>
  <li>The local z direction is in parallel with and directed like the surface normal.</li>
</ul>

<p><u>Informal propositions</u>:</p>

<p><b><u>Coordinate Systems</u></b>:</p>

<p>See definitions at <i>IfcStructuralItem</i>.  The local coordinate system is established by the reference curve given by topology representation and by the attribute <i>Axis</i>.  The local x axis is parallel with the tangent on the reference curve.  The local z axis is located in the surface which is created by sweeping <i>Axis</i> along the reference curve and is directed according to <i>Axis</i>.  The local y axis is directed such that x,y,z form a right-handed Cartesian coordinate system.</p>

<p><b><u>Material Use Definition</u></b></p>

<p>The material of direct instances <i>IfcStructuralCurveMember</i> (in contrast to instances of the subtype <i>IfcStructuralCurveMemberVarying</i>) is defined by <i>IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage</i> and attached by the <i>IfcRelAssociatesMaterial.RelatingMaterial</i>.  It is accessible by the inverse <i>HasAssociations</i> relationship.  Composite profile beams can be represented by refering to several <i>IfcMaterialProfile</i>s within the <i>IfcMaterialProfileSet</i> that is referenced from the <i>IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage</i>.  In case of tapered members, the material profile usage subtype <i>IfcMaterialProfileSetUsageDual</i> is used which specifies <i>IfcMaterialProfileSet</i>s separately at the start and the end of the tapered member.</p>

<p>The material (<i>IfcMaterial</i>) in each <i>IfcMaterialProfile</i>(<i>Set</i>) is specified minimally by a name which corresponds with an agreed upon standardized structural material designation.  An external reference to the source which specifies the material designation should be provided.  Alternatively, structural material properties may be provided by means of <i>IfcMechanicalMaterialProperties</i> and <i>IfcExtendedMaterialProperties</i>.</p>

<p>The profile (<i>IfcProfileDef</i>) in each <i>IfcMaterialProfile</i>(<i>Set</i>) is specified minimally by a name which corresponds with an agreed upon standardized structural profile designation.  An external reference to the source which specifies the profile designation should be provided.  Alternatively or additionally, explicit profile geometry should be provided by using respective subtypes of <i>IfcProfileDef</i>.  Alternatively or additionally, structural profile properties may be provided by means of subtypes of <i>IfcProfileProperties</i>.</p>

<p>An <i>IfcProfileDef</i> is a two-dimensional geometric object with a x<sub>p</sub>,y<sub>p</sub> coordinate system.  The profile is inserted into the curve member model thus that the origin of x<sub>p</sub>,y<sub>p</sub> is located at the member's reference curve and that x<sub>p</sub>,y<sub>p</sub> are parallel with and directed like the local y,z.</p>

<blockquote><font size=""-1"">NOTE&nbsp;  Due to convention in structural mechanics, axis names of <i>IfcStructuralCurveMember</i> differ from axis names of building elements like <i>IfcBeamStandardCase</i>:  The extrusion axis of <i>IfcStructuralCurveMember</i> is called x while the extrusion axis of <i>IfcBeamStandardCase</i> is called z.  Hence x,y,z of <i>IfcStructuralCurveMember</i> correspond with z,x,y of <i>IfcBeamStandardCase</i>.</font></blockquote>

<p>If the profile is meant to be inserted centrically in terms of structural section properties, it is necessary that the origin of x<sub>p</sub>,y<sub>p</sub> is identical with the geometric centroid of the profile (commonly also called centre of gravity).  If subtypes of <i>IfcParameterizedProfileDef</i> are used which are only singly symmetric or are asymmetric, an explicit translation by <i>IfcParameterizedProfileDef.Position.Location</i> is required then.</p>

<p>If the profile is inserted at its geometric centroid, <i>IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage.CardinalPoint</i> shall be set to 10.</p>

<p>Otherwise, the profile is inserted eccentrically and a different cardinal point should be set accordingly.</p>

<blockquote><font size=""-1"">NOTE&nbsp;  Another eccentricity model is available independently of eccentric profile specification:  The reference curve of the member may be located eccentrically relative to the reference points of the connected <i>IfcStructuralPointConnection</i>s.  The connection relationship is then established by <i>IfcRelConnectsWithEccentricity</i>.  Whether one or the other or both eccentricity models may be used is subject to information requirements and local agreements.</font></blockquote>

<p><b><u>Topology Use Definitions</u></b>:</p>

<p>Direct instances of <i>IfcStructuralCurveMember</i> shall have a topology representation which consists of one instance of <i>IfcEdge</i> or a subtype, representing the reference curve of the curve member.  See definitions at <i>IfcStructuralItem</i> for further specifications.</p>

<p><u>Definition from IAI:</u> The entity <i>IfcStructuralLoadGroup</i> is used to structure the
physical impacts.  By using the grouping features inherited from <i>IfcGroup</i>, instances of
<i>IfcStructuralAction</i> (or its subclasses) and of <i>IfcStructuralLoadGroup</i> can be used to
define load groups, load cases and load combinations.  (See also <i>IfcLoadGroupTypeEnum</i>.)</p>

<blockquote><font size=""-1"">NOTE: Important functionality for the description of a load-bearing system
is derived from the existing IFC entity <i>IfcGroup</i>.  This class provides, via the relationship
class <i>IfcRelAssignsToGroup</i>, the needed grouping mechanism.  In this way, instances of
<i>IfcStructuralAction</i> belonging to a specific load group can be unambiguously determined.
</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font size=""-1"">NOTE: The relationship class <i>IfcRelAssignsToGroupByFactor</i> is
used to group load cases into load combinations.  The factor provided in this assignment relationship
is to applied together with the optional <i>IfcStructuralLoadGroup.Coefficient</i>.  Unlike this
coefficient which always affects the load group, the <i>IfcRelAssignsToGroupByFactor.Factor</i> is
specific for a load case&mdash;load combination pair.  As many instances of
<i>IfcRelAssignsToGroupByFactor</i> are used within one load combination as there are different

2087;IfcStructuralActivity;"<EPM-HTML>

<p><u>Definition from IAI:</u> The abstract entity <i>IfcStructuralActivity</i> combines the definition of actions (such as forces, displacements, etc.) and reactions (support reactions, internal forces, deflections, etc.) which are specified by using the basic load definitions from the <i>IfcStructuralLoadResource</i>.</p>

<p>The differentiation between actions and reactions is realized by instantiating objects either from subclasses of <i>IfcStructuralAction</i> or <i>IfcStructuralReaction</i> respectively.  They inherit commonly needed attributes from the abstract superclass <i>IfcStructuralActivity</i>, notably the relationship which connects actions or reactions with connections, analysis members, or elements (subtypes of <i>IfcStructuralItem</i> or <i>IfcElement</i>).</p>

<blockquote><font size=""-1"">NOTE&nbsp; Instances of <i>IfcStructuralActivity</i> which are connected with an <i>IfcElement</i> are subject to agreements outside the scope of this specification.</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font size=""-1"">NOTE&nbsp; The semantics of <i>IfcStructuralActivity</i> are only fully defined
if an activity instance is connected with exactly one structural item.  The inverse attribute
<i>AssignedToStructuralItem</i> can only be empty in incomplete models or in conceptual models
which are not yet ready for analysis.</font></blockquote>

<p><b><u>Coordinate Systems</u></b>:</p>

<p>The following coordinate systems are distinguished:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The so-called global coordinate system is the coordinate system shared by all items and activities which are grouped in a common <i>IfcStructuralAnalysisModel</i>.  This coordinate system is established by an <i>ObjectPlacement</i>.  (This coordinate system is not necessarily the same as the <i>IfcProject</i>'s world coordinate system.)</li>
  <li>The so-called local coordinate system is a coordinate system local to a structural item (connection or member).  This coordinate system is established by a <i>Representation</i> in conjunction with further use definitions and attributes of subtypes of <i>IfcStructuralItem</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Representation items in topology representations are always given within the <i>ObjectPlacement</i>, i.e. in so-called global coordinates (global with respect to the <i>IfcStructuralAnalysisModel</i> to which this activity belongs).</i>

<p>Locations of the load objects in the <i>AppliedLoad</i> attribute (if of type <i>IfcStructuralLoadConfiguration</i>) are always given in local coordinates.</p>

<p>Directions of the load objects in the <i>AppliedLoad</i> attribute refer to global or local coordinates according to the <i>GlobalOrLocal</i> attribute.</p>

<p>The <i>ObjectPlacement</i> and <i>Representation</i> are sometimes not explicitly instantiated; instead they may be implied as described below.  Global and local coordinate systems are then determined in the same way as with explicit placement and representation.</p>

<p><b><u>Topology Use Definitions</u></b>:</p>

<p>Instances of <i>IfcStructuralActivity</i> which are connected with a structural item of same dimensionality, i.e.</p>
<ul>
  <li>a point action or reaction connected with a point item (<i>IfcStructuralPointConnection</i>),</li>
  <li>a curve action or reaction connected with a curve item (<i>IfcStructuralCurveConnection</i>, <i>IfcStructuralCurveMember</i>), or</li>
  <li>a surface action or reaction connected with a surface item (<i>IfcStructuralSurfaceConnection</i>, <i>IfcStructuralSurfaceMember</i>) and which acts on the entire surface of the item and is not specified by isocontours</li>
</ul>
<p>shall not have an <i>ObjectPlacement</i> nor a <i>Representation</i>.  It is implied that the placement and representation of the <i>IfcStructuralActivity</i> is the same as the ones of the <i>IfcStructuralItem</i>.</p>

<p>Instances of <i>IfcStructuralActivity</i> which are connected with</p>
<ul>
  <li>a curve item (<i>IfcStructuralCurveConnection</i>, <i>IfcStructuralCurveMember</i>) and act on a point of the item</li>, or
  <li>a surface item (<i>IfcStructuralSurfaceConnection</i>, <i>IfcStructuralSurfaceMember</i>) and act on a point or on a curve or on a part of the surface of the item</li>
</ul>
<p>shall have a topology representation as specified below.  It includes a placement and a product representation. The <i>IfcProductRepresentation</i> shall be given by an item in a <i>Representation</i> of type <i>IfcTopologyRepresentation</i>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>a surface item (<i>IfcStructuralSurfaceConnection</i>, <i>IfcStructuralSurfaceMember</i>) and are specified by isocontours</li>
</ul>
<p>shall have a shape representation as specified below.  It includes a placement and a product representation. The <i>IfcProductRepresentation</i> shall be given by items in a <i>Representation</i> of type <i>IfcShapeRepresentation</i>.  Shape representation and topology representation may be combined.</p>

<p><b>Local Placement</b></p>

<p>The local placement for <i>IfcStructuralActivity</i> is defined in its supertype <I>IfcProduct</I>.  It is defined by the <i>IfcLocalPlacement</i>, which establishes a global coordinate system which shall be common to all items and activities in an <i>IfcStructuralAnalysisModel</i>.</p>

<p><b>Topology Representation</b></p>

<p>Instances of <i>IfcStructuralActivity</i> which act on parts of a surface item shall have a topology representation given by a face with underlying surface geometry, <i>IfcFaceSurface</i>, which should be the single item of <i>IfcTopologyRepresentation.Items</i>.  The surface establishes a local coordinate system of the activity:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The origin of surface parameters u,v is the origin of the local coordinate system.</li>
  <li>The local x and y directions follow the tangents on the surface and are in parallel with and directed like u and v respectively.</li>
  <li>The local z direction is in parallel with and directed like the surface normal.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li><i>RepresentationIdentifier</i>: 'Reference'</li>
    <li><i>RepresentationType</i>: 'Face'</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Instances of <i>IfcStructuralActivity</i> which act on a curve on a surface item shall have a topology representation given by an edge (<i>IfcEdge</i> or subtype), which should be the single item of <i>IfcTopologyRepresentation.Items</i>.  The curve geometry shall be compatible with the surface geometry of the connected item.  In conjunction with this surface, the curve establishes a local coordinate system of the activity:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The origin of the curve parameter u is the origin of the local coordinate system.</li>
  <li>The local x direction follows the tangent on the curve and is directed like u.</li>
  <li>The local z direction is in parallel with and directed like the surface normal of the connected surface item.</li>
  <li>The local x,y,z directions form a right-handed Cartesian coordinate system.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li><i>RepresentationIdentifier</i>: 'Reference'</li>
    <li><i>RepresentationType</i>: 'Edge'</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><font size=""-1"">NOTE&nbsp; While an <i>IfcEdge</i> (or <i>IfcOrientedEdge</i> with underlying <i>IfcEdge</i>) does not provide an explicit underlying curve geometry, it may be used to imply an underlying straight line as reference curve with the origin of the curve parameter at the start vertex point.</font></blockquote>

<p>Instances of <i>IfcStructuralActivity</i> which act on a single point on a curve or surface item shall have a topology representation given by an <i>IfcVertexPoint</i>, which should be the single item of <i>IfcTopologyRepresentation.Items</i>.  The point geometry shall be compatible with the curve or surface geometry of the connected item.  The local coordinate system of the activity is oriented by the curve or surface geometry of the connected item as described above for activities with edge or face topology.</p>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li><i>RepresentationIdentifier</i>: 'Reference'</li>
    <li><i>RepresentationType</i>: 'Vertex'</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p><b>Shape Representation</b></p>

<p>Instances of <i>IfcStructuralActivity</i> which act on a surface item and are specified by isocontours (level sets) shall have a shape representation given by a set of curves on a surface, <i>IfcPCurve</i>.  The basis surface shall comply with or preferably be identical with the surface of the structural item to which the activity is connected.  The representation identifier and type of this geometric representation is:</p>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li><i>RepresentationIdentifier</i>: 'Level set'</li>
    <li><i>RepresentationType</i>: 'GeometricCurveSet'</li>
  </ul>

<p><u>Definition from IAI:</u> A structural action is a structural activity that acts upon

<p>Structural actions are grouped into either an <i>IfcStructuralLoadGroup</i> of predefined
type LOAD_GROUP or, more often, an <i>IfcStructuralLoadCase</i>.  This is accomplished via the
inverse relationship <i>HasAssignments</i> and an <i>IfcRelAssignsToGroup</i> relationship object.

refers to the structural analysis model(s) in which the loads are used.</p>

<p>It is furthermore possible to establish relationships between actions in one analysis model
and reactions in another analysis model which cause the actions.  For example, a support reaction
from one structural system may be taken over as a load onto another supporting structural system.
This is expressed by means of the inverse relationship <i>ReferencedBy</i> of the action and an
<i>IfcRelAssignsToProduct</i> relationship object.  <i>IfcRelAssignsToProduct.Name</i> is set to
'Causes' and <i>IfcRelAssignsToProduct.RelatedObjects</i> refers to an instance of a subtype of

<p><i>IfcGeometricRepresentationContext</i> defines the context that

to the geometric representation items defined in this context. In
addition it can be used to offset the project coordinate system
from a global point of origin, using the
<i>WorldCoordinateSystem</i> attribute.</p>

<p>As shown in Figure 329, the <i>TrueNorth</i> attribute should be provided if the y axis of the <i>WorldCoordinateSystem</i> does not point to the global northing. Direction of the true north, or geographic northing direction, relative to the underlying project coordinate
system as established by the attribute <i>WorldCoordinateSystem</i>. It is given by a 2 dimensional direction within the xy-plane of the project coordinate system. If not resent, it defaults to [0.,1.] - i.e. the positive Y axis of the project coordinate system equals the geographic northing direction. The direction is provided within project coordinate system and identifies the true north direction (see

    <p>
      <u>Definition from OpenGIS&reg; Abstract Specification,
      Topic 2:</u> If the relationship between any two coordinate
      reference systems is known, coordinates can be transformed
      or converted to another coordinate reference system.
      Coordinate operations are divided into two subtypes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <i>Coordinate conversion</i> &ndash; mathematical
        operation on coordinates that does not include any change
        of datum. The best-known example of a coordinate
        conversion is a map projection. The parameters describing
        coordinate conversions are defined rather than
        empirically derived. Note that some conversions have no
        parameters.
      </li>
      <li>
        <i>Coordinate transformation</i> &ndash; mathematical
        operation on coordinates that usually includes a change
        of datum. The parameters of a coordinate transformation
        are empirically derived from data containing the
        coordinates of a series of points in both coordinate
        reference systems. This computational process is usually
        &lsquo;over-determined&rsquo;, allowing derivation of
        error (or accuracy) estimates for the transformation.
        Also, the stochastic nature of the parameters may result
        in multiple (different) versions of the same coordinate
        transformation. Because of this several transformations
        may exist for a given pair of coordinate reference
        systems, differing in their transformation method,
        parameter values and accuracy characteristics.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The coordinate operation is an
      abstract supertype to handle any operation (transformation
      or conversion) between two coordinate reference systems. It
      is meant to provide expandability for future versions,
      since currently only the conversion of a local engineering
      coordinate system into a map coordinate reference system is
      dealt with by the subtype <i>IfcMapConversion</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      By convention, a coordinate operation is given between the
      <i>SourceCRS</i> being the more local, or child coordinate
      reference system, and the <i>TargetCRS</i> being the more
      remote or parent coordinate reference system, in
      theÿspecial case the coordinate operation between the local
      engineering coordinate system of the construction project
      and any map or other coordinate reference system.

<blockquote class=""note"">
NOTE&nbsp; The <i>IfcMapConversion</i> does not handle the projection of a map from the geodetic coordinate reference system.
</blockquote>

<p>The map conversion allows to convert the local origin of the local engineering coordinate system to its place within a map (easting, northing, orthogonal height) and to rotate the x-axis of the local engineering coordinate system within the horizontal (easting/westing) plane of the map.</p>

<blockquote class=""note"">
NOTE&nbsp; The z axis of the local engineering coordinate system is always parallel to the z axis of the map coordinate system.
</blockquote>

<p>The scale factor can be used when the length unit for the 3 axes of the map coordinate system are not identical with the length unit established for this project (seeÿ<i>IfcProject.UnitsInContext</i>), if omitted, the scale factor 1.0 is assumed.</p>

	 <p><u>Definition from ISO/CD 10303-42:1992</u>: A closed shell is a shell
		of the dimensionality 2 which typically serves as a bound for a region in R3. A
		closed shell has no boundary, and has non-zero finite extent. If the shell has
		a domain with coordinate space R3, it divides that space into two connected
		regions, one finite and the other infinite. In this case, the topological
		normal of the shell is defined as being directed from the finite to the
		infinite region. </p> 
	 <p>The shell is represented by a collection of faces. The domain of the
		shell, if present, contains all those faces, together with their bounds.
		Associated with each face in the shell is a logical value which indicates
		whether the face normal agrees with (TRUE) or is opposed to (FALSE) the shell
		normal. The logical value can be applied directly as a BOOLEAN attribute of an
		oriented face, or be defaulted to TRUE if the shell boundary attribute member
		is a face without the orientation attribute. </p> 
	 <p>The combinatorial restrictions on closed shells and geometrical
		restrictions on their domains are designed to ensure that any domain associated
		with a closed shell is a closed, orientable manifold. The domain of a closed
		shell, if present, is a connected, closed, oriented 2-manifold. It is always
		topologically equivalent to an <i>H</i>-fold torus for some <i>H</i>

2415;IfcEdge;"<EPM-HTML> 
<p><u>Definition from ISO/CD 10303-42:1992</u>: An edge is the
topological construct corresponding to the connection of two
vertices. More abstractly, it may stand for a logical
relationship between two vertices. The domain of an edge, if
present, is a finite, non-self-intersecting open curve in
<i>R<sup>M</sup></i>, that is, a connected 1-dimensional
manifold. The bounds of an edge are two vertices, which need not
be distinct. The edge is oriented by choosing its traversal
direction to run from the first to the second vertex. If the two
vertices are the same, the edge is a self loop. The domain of the
edge does not include its bounds, and 0 &le; &Xi; &le; &infin;.
Associated with an edge may be a geometric curve to locate the
edge in a coordinate space; this is represented by the edge curve
(<i>IfcEdgeCurve</i>) subtype. The curve shall be finite and
non-self-intersecting within the domain of the edge. An edge is a
graph, so its multiplicity M and graph genus <i>G<sup>e</sup></i>
may be determined by the graph traversal algorithm. Since
<i>M</i> = <i>E</i> = 1, the Euler equation (1) reduces in the
case to</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img src=""figures/IfcEdge-Math1.gif"" width=""105"" height=
""24""></p>
</blockquote>
<p>where <i>V</i> = 1 or 2, and <i>G<sup>e</sup></i> = 1 or 0.
Specifically, the topological edge defining data shall
satisfy:</p>
<dl>
<dd>- an edge has two vertices
<dl>
<dd><img src=""figures/IfcEdge-Math2.gif"" width=""64"" height=
""26""></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>- the vertices need not be distinct
<dl>
<dd><img src=""figures/IfcEdge-Math3.gif"" width=""88"" height=

</dl>
</dd>
<dd>- Equation (2) shall hold.
<dl>
<dd><img src=""figures/IfcEdge-Math4.gif"" width=""120"" height=
""26""></dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The geometry between the two
vertices defaults to a straight line if no curve geometry is
assigned using the subtype <i>IfcEdgeCurve</i>. The
<i>IfcEdge</i> can therefore be used to exchange straight edges
without an associated geometry provided by <i>IfcLine</i> or
<i>IfcPolyline</i> thought <i>IfcEdgeCurve.EdgeGeometry</i>.</p>

<p>Figure 333 illustrates an example where the bounds of the <i>IfcEdge</i> are given by the <i>EdgeStart</i> and <i>EdgeEnd</i>; this also determines the direction of the edge. The location within a coordinate space is determined by the <i>IfcVertexPoint</i> type for <i>EdgeStart</i> and <i>EdgeEnd</i>. Since no edge geometry is assigned, it defaults to a straight line agreeing to the direction sense.</p>

	 <p><u>Definition from ISO/CD 10303-42:1992</u>: A face is a topological
		entity of dimensionality 2 corresponding to the intuitive notion of a piece of
		surface bounded by loops. Its domain, if present, is an oriented, connected,
		finite 2-manifold in <i>R<sup>m</sup></i>. A face domain shall not have handles
		but it may have holes, each hole bounded by a loop. The domain of the
		underlying geometry of the face, if present, does not contain its bounds, and 0
		&lt; &Xi; &lt; &infin;.</p> 
	 <p>A face is represented by its bounding loops, which are defined as face
		bounds. A face has a topological normal n and the tangent to a loop is t. For a
		loop bounding a face with defined geometry, the cross product n x t points
		toward the interior of the face. That is, each loop runs counter-clockwise
		around the face when viewed from above, if we consider the normal n to point
		up. With each loop is associated a BOOLEAN flag to signify whether the loop
		direction is oriented with respect to the face normal (TRUE) or should be
		reversed (FALSE). </p> 
	 <p>A face shall have at least one bound, and the loops shall not intersect.
		One loop is optionally distinguished as the outer loop of the face. If so, it
		establishes a preferred way of embedding the face domain in the plane, in which
		the other bounding loops of the face are inside the outer bound. Because the
		face domain is arcwise connected, no inner loop will contain any other loop.
		This is true regardless of which embedding in the plane is chosen. </p> 
	 <p>The edges and vertices referenced by the loops of a face form a graph,
		of which the individual loops are the connected components. The Euler equation

	 <p><u>Definition from ISO/CD 10303-42:1992</u>: An open shell is a shell of

		a closed shell with one or more holes punched in it. The domain of an open
		shell satisfies 0
		&lt; &Xi; &lt; 1. An open shell is
		functionally more general than a face because its domain can have handles.</p> 
	 <p>The shell is defined by a collection of faces, which may be oriented
		faces. The sense of each face, after taking account of the orientation, shall

      An <i>IfcTask</i> is an identifiable unit of work to be
      carried out in a construction project.
    </p>
    <p>
      A task is typically used to describe an activity for the
      construction or installation of products, but is not
      limited to these types. For example it might be used to
      describe design processes, move operations and other
      design, construction and operation related activities as
      well.

      <i>IfcTask</i> defines the anticipated or actual occurrence
      of any task; common information about task types is handled
      by <i>IfcTaskType</i>. The <i>IfcTaskType</i> (if present)
      may establish the common type name, usage (or predefined)
      type, common set of properties, and common product
      assignment using <i>IfcRelAssignsToProduct</i>. The
      <i>IfcTaskType</i> is attached using the
      <i>IfcRelDefinesByType.RelatingType</i> objectified
      relationship and is accessible by the inverse
      <i>IsTypedBy</i> attribute. Special type information
      relating to a task occurrence is asserted using
      <i>IfcTask.ObjectType</i> (inherited from
      <i>IfcObject</i>). Examples that may be used include fixed
      duration, fixed unit or fixed work. <i>IfcTask</i> can be
      aggregated to a task type in order to specify a task
      sequence or any time related information, e.g. the duration
      of a task. Please see the documentation of
      <i>IfcTaskType</i> for further information.
    </p>
    <p class=""use-head"">Attribute use definition</p>
    <p>
      Each occurrence of <i>IfcTask</i> is given a name that is
      indicative of its content (<i>IfcRoot.Name</i>). A textual
      description of the task may be provided and this may be
      further elaborated by a narrative long description
      (<i>IfcProcess.LongDescription</i>). A work method may be
      declared for the method of work used in carrying out a
      task. A task is identified as being either a milestone task
      or not. A milestone task is defined by the marker
      <i>IsMilestone</i>. and has no duration. A status and
      priority for each task may also be set.
    </p>
    <p class=""use-head"">Property set use definition</p>
    <p>
      The property sets relating to <i>IfcTask</i> are defined by
      <i>IfcPropertySet</i> and attached by the
      <i>IfcRelDefinesByProperties</i> relationship. They are
      accessible by the inverse <i>IsDefinedBy</i> relationship.
      Such property sets may define task parameters. No property
      sets for <i>IfcTask</i> are currently defined by IFC.
    </p>
    <p class=""use-head"">Connectivity Use Definition</p>
    <p>
      The relationship <i>IfcRelSequence</i> is used to indicate
      control flow. An <i>IfcTask</i> as a successor to an
      <i>IfcTask</i> indicates logical sequence how these tasks
      should be performed. <i>IfcTask</i>'s can be triggered or
      can trigger <i>IfcEvent</i>'s, which is also defined
      through the relationship <i>IfcRelSequence</i>.
    </p>
    <p class=""use-head"">Composition use definition</p>
    <p>
      <i>IfcTask</i> may be contained within an <i>IfcTask</i>
      using the <i>IfcRelNests</i> relationship. An
      <i>IfcTask</i> may in turn nest other <i>IfcTask</i>,
      <i>IfcProcedure</i> or <i>IfcEvent</i> entities. Such
      nesting indicates decomposed level of detail. From IFC2x4
      onwards it is required to have a summary task (root of all
      tasks), which is used to define a link to the work plan or
      work schedule. All subtasks of the summary tasks are then
      implicitly linked to this work plan or work schedule.
      Please note that the summary task is used for data
      organization and not meant to store typical task
      information as defined by the user. It is therefore
      recommended that the summary task is hidden from the user
      to avoid confusion. Please also note that
      <i>IfcRelNests</i> is used to show the dependency between
      regular tasks and recurring task definitions (please see
      the section about time and duration use definitions).
    </p>

    <p>
      As shown in Figure 13, the installation of a number of items of equipment within a
      particular space may be the subject of a single task which
      is identified as 'fix equipment in space 123'.
      <i>IfcTask</i> represents the occurrence of a work
      performance of a type of process in a construction plan.

    <p>
      A task may nest other tasks as sub-items; the nesting
      relationship is modeled by <i>IfcRelNests</i> as shown in Figure 14. For example,
      the construction of a stud wall may be designated as a
      nesting task named 'install wall #1' including other tasks
      such as 'install dry wall', 'install studs', 'wall taping',
      and 'erect wall' as sub-processes. A value that indicates
      the relative tree view position of the task (in comparison
      to the tree view position of other tasks and the task
      hierarchy defined by <i>IfcRelNests</i>).
    <p>The task order information that is used for viewing
      purposes is derived from the order defined by the
      <i>IfcRelNests</i> relationship and thus is independent of
      the logical task order defined through
      <i>IfcRelSequence</i>. The hierarchy and order defined
      through <i>IfcRelNests</i> enables to order the tasks in a
      tree view or list view structure.

    <p class=""use-head"">Time and duration use definition</p>
    <p>
      Compared to previous IFC releases, basic task time
      information (scheduled start time, scheduled finish
      time, duration) is now directly attached to <i>IfcTask</i>
      through the <i>TaskTime</i> attribute. Regular tasks are
      defined through <i>IfcTaskTime</i>. Recurring tasks are
      defined through <i>IfcTaskTimeRecurring</i>. In case a
      regular task is derived from a recurring task both tasks
      should be linked together through a <i>IfcRelNests</i>
      relationship, where <i>IfcRelNests.IsNestedBy</i> points to
      the recurring task and <i>IfcRelNests.Nests</i> points to
      all regular tasks that have been derived from the recurring
      task.
    </p>
    <p class=""use-head"">Assignment use definition</p>
    <p>
      Occurrences of <i>IfcTask</i> may be assigned to an
      <i>IfcWorkControl</i> (either a work plan or a work
      schedule) through <i>IfcRelAssignsToControl</i>. From
      IFC2x4 onwards it is suggested to use the 'summary task'
      (root element of the task hierarchy that is required for
      task management purposes) to assign all subtask to a work
      plan or work schedule. Resources used by tasks are assigned
      by <i>IfcRelAssignsToProcess</i>. Quantities of resources
      consumed by the task are dealt with by defining the
      <i>IfcElementQuantity</i> for the resource and not at the
      instance of <i>IfcTask</i>. Please note that the
      <i>IfcRelAssignsTasks</i> relationship class has been
      removed in IFC2x4 and is no longer available.
    </p>
    <p>
      An <i>IfcTask</i> may be assigned a Work Breakdown
      Structure (WBS) code. A WBS code is dealt with as a
      classification of task and is associated to a task
      occurrence using the <i>IfcRelAssociatesClassification</i>
      relationship class. As well as being to designate the code,
      the classification structure of the IFC model also enables
      the source of the work breakdown structure classification
      to be identified.
    </p>
    <p class=""use-head"">Constraint use definition</p>
    <p>
      Constraints may be applied to a task to indicate fixed task
      duration, fixed start or fixed finish (see Figure 15). The relationship
      <i>IfcRelAssociatesConstraint</i> is used where
      <i>RelatingConstraint</i> points to an <i>IfcMetric</i> and
      <i>RelatedObjects</i> includes the <i>IfcTask</i>.
      <i>IfcRelAssociatesConstraint.Name</i> identifies the
      attribute to be constrained using a period (""."") to
      dereference; for example, ""TaskTime.ScheduleStart"" refers
      to the <i>ScheduleStart</i> attribute on the
      <i>IfcTaskTime</i> entity referenced on the <i>TaskTime</i>
      attribute. The following attributes may be constrained:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>'TaskTime.ScheduleDuration'</b>: Indicate fixed
        duration of task with ConstraintGrade=HARD and
        Benchmark=EQUALTO such that changes to an assigned
        <i>IfcConstructionResource.ResourceTime.ScheduleWork</i>
        should impact
        <i>IfcConstructionResource.ResourceTime.ScheduleUsage</i>,
        and vice-versa.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>'TaskTime.ScheduleStart'</b>: Indicate constrained
        start date with ConstraintGrade=HARD and Benchmark of
        EQUALTO, GREATERTHANOREQUALTO, or LESSTHANOREQUALTO to
        indicate ""must start on"", ""start no earlier than"" or
        ""start no later than"" respectively where
        <i>IfcMetric.DataValue</i> indicates the specific
        <i>IfcDateTime</i>. Use SOFT constraint having LESSTHAN
        benchmark to indicate ""start as soon as possible"".
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>'TaskTime.ScheduleFinish'</b>: Indicate constrained
        finish date with ConstraintGrade=HARD and Benchmark of
        EQUALTO, GREATERTHANOREQUALTO, or LESSTHANOREQUALTO to
        indicate ""must finish on"", ""finish no earlier than"" or
        ""finish no later than"" respectively where
        <i>IfcMetric.DateValue</i> indicates the specific
        <i>IfcDateTime</i>. Use SOFT constraint having
        GREATERTHAN benchmark to indicate ""finish as late as
        possible"".
      </li>
    </ul>

      that had been defined by own entities in previous IFC
      releases. This includes

      <i>IfcTask</i> represents an order that might be carried
      out by a Helpdesk acting the role of interface for the
      organization between the facility user and the functional
      requirement of fulfilling their needs. The actual task
      represented by the <i>IfcTask</i> entity is turning a
      request into an order and initiating the action that will
      enable the order to be completed. The
      <i>IfcProjectOrder</i> or one of its subtypes including
      maintenance work order, is related to the <i>IfcTask</i>
      using <i>IfcRelAssignsToControl</i>.
    </p>

      <i>IfcTask</i> can also be used to describe an activity
      that moves people, groups within an organization or
      complete organizations together with their associated

      replaces the previous IFC entity IfcMove. The functionality
      is represented in <i>IfcTask</i> as follows:<br>

      The relationship <i>IfcRelSequence</i> is used to indicate

      <i>IfcEvent</i> indicates that the procedure should be
      performed in response to the event. An <i>IfcProcedure</i>
      as a predecessor to an <i>IfcEvent</i> indicates that the
      event should be trigerred following the procedure. As
      procedures have arbitrary duration, the
      <i>IfcRelSequence.SequenceType</i> attribute has no effect
      on an <i>IfcProcedure</i> but still applies to the opposite
      end of the relationship if <i>IfcTask</i> is used.

      <i>IfcProcedure</i> may be contained within an

      in turn nest other <i>IfcProcedure</i> or <i>IfcEvent</i>
      entities. Such nesting indicates decomposed level of
      detail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that a particular type of <i>IfcProcedure</i> is a
      caution, warning or other form of advisory note. Typically,
      it is anticipated that such a procedure would be assigned
      to the specific <i>IfcProcess</i> for which it gives advice
      using <i>IfcRelAssignsToProcess</i>.
    </p>
    <p class=""use-head"">Assignment use definition</p>

      An <i>IfcProcedure</i> may be assigned to an
      <i>IfcWorkCalendar</i> to indicate times when such
      procedure may be performed using
      <i>IfcRelAssignsToControl</i>; otherwise the effective
      calendar is determined by the nearest <i>IfcProcess</i>
      ancestor with a calendar assigned. Advisory notes should be
      assigned to the specific <i>IfcProcess</i> for which it
      gives advice using <i>IfcRelAssignsToProcess</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For building operation scenarios, <i>IfcProcedure</i> may
      be assigned to a product (<i>IfcElement</i> subtype) using
      <i>IfcRelAssignsToProduct</i> to indicate a specific
      product occurrence that performs the procedure. For
      example, an <i>IfcActuator</i> may have a ""Close""
      procedure. If the <i>IfcProcedure</i> is defined by an
      <i>IfcProcedureType</i> and the <i>IfcProcedureType</i> is
      assigned to a product type (using

    </p>
     
    <p>As shown in Figure 12, <i>IfcProcedure</i> does not restrict anything but
    describes specific steps of how something should happen.
    While a procedure does control/restrict in the sense of
    indicating ""this is how the task should be performed"" by
    nature of describing inner detail, this is not different than
    parts of a product indicating ""this is how the parts should

      <i>IfcEvent</i> defines the anticipated or actual occurrence of

      establish the common type name, usage (or predefined) type,
      common set of properties, and common product assignment
      using <i>IfcRelAssignsToProduct</i>. The <i>IfcEventType</i> is attached

      The relationship <i>IfcRelSequence</i> is used to indicate control
      flow. An <i>IfcEvent</i> as a predecessor
      (<i>IfcRelSequence.RelatingProcess</i>) indicates that the
      succeeding process (typically <i>IfcProcedure</i> or <i>IfcTask</i>) is
      triggered in response to the event. An <i>IfcEvent</i> as a
      successor (<i>IfcRelSequence.RelatedProcess</i>) indicates that
      the completion of the preceeding process causes the event
      to be triggered. As events have zero duration, the
      <i>IfcRelSequence.SequenceType</i> attribute has no effect on an
      <i>IfcEvent</i> but still applies to the opposite end of the
      relationship if <i>IfcTask</i> is used.

      <i>IfcEvent</i> may be contained within an <i>IfcTask</i> using the

      during the time period of the enclosing task (including any
      assigned <i>IfcWorkCalendar</i>); that is such event may be
      triggered within the task time period but not outside of
      it. As an <i>IfcEvent</i> is considered to be atomic, no use is
      anticipated for nesting processes inside the event.

      An <i>IfcEvent</i> may be assigned to an <i>IfcWorkCalendar</i> to

      For building operation scenarios, <i>IfcEvent</i> may be assigned
      to a product (<i>IfcElement</i> subtype) using
      <i>IfcRelAssignsToProduct</i> to indicate a specific product
      occurrence that sources the event. For example, an
      <i>IfcSensor</i> for a motion sensor may have a ""Motion Sensed""
      event. If the <i>IfcEvent</i> is defined by an <i>IfcEventType</i> and
      the <i>IfcEventType</i> is assigned to a product type (using

<p>A work calendar is a subtype of <i>IfcControl</i> and thus inherits the feature for controlling other objects through <i>IfcRelAssignsToControl</i>, which is used to define a work calendar for tasks (<i>IfcTask</i>) and resources (<i>IfcResource</i>). It also inherits a name and description attribute, whereas a name shall be given and a description may be given as an indication of its content and usage.</p>

<p>The definition of time periods can be derived from a base calendar and/or modified/defined by a set of working times and non-working exception times. All time periods defined by <i>IfcWorkCalendar.ExceptionTimes</i> override the time periods inherited from the base calendar (base calendar is defined as the next applicable calendar for the task or resource). Thus, exception times replace the working times from the base calendar.</p>

<p>The base calendar of a work calendar is defined by <i>IfcRelAssignsToControl</i>, where <i>IfcRelAssignsToControl.RelatingControl</i> is linked with the base calendar and <i>IfcRelAssignsToControl.RelatedObjects</i> is linked with work calendars that are derived from the base calendar. Although not restricted by the <i>IfcRelAssignsToControl</i> relationship it is only allowed to have one base calendar.</p>

<p>Figure 17 shows the definition of a work calendar, which is defined by a set of work times and exception times. The work times are defined as recurring patterns with optional boundaries (applying from and/or to a specific date). The shown example defines a simple work calendar with working times Monday to Thursday 8:00 to 12:00 and 13:00 to 17:00, Friday 8:00 to 14:00 and as exception every 1st Monday in a month the work starts one hour later - i.e. the working time on every 1st Monday in a month is overriden to be 9:00 to 12:00 and 13:00 to 17:00. Both the working time and the exception time is valid for the period of 01.09.2010 till 30.08.2011.</p>

      <em>IfcRelSequence</em> is used to describe the logical
      sequence relationship that exists between two processes.
      This logical relationship identifies that there is a
      predecessor or relating process and a successor or related
      process. In IFC, there may be one predecessor and one
      successor in the relationship. Many occurrences of
      <em>IfcRelSequence</em> may exist to describe the sequence
      relationships of a predecessor task with many successor
      tasks or of many predecessor tasks with one successor task,
      thus enabling a m:n sequence relationship between tasks.
      Please note that sequence relationships always should stay
      within the limits of a directed, non-cyclic graph.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sequence type may be set for a sequence. For tasks
      assigned to a work schedule, it is expected that the
      sequence type will be asserted. For a process map, where
      the sequence relationship between processes is simply a
      logical flow, it need not be asserted.
    </p>
    <p>
      A time lag may be assigned to a sequence, and the sequence
      type defines the way in which the time lag applies to the
      sequence either as a ratio or percentage of time duration
      (e.g. start successor task when predecessor is 50%
      complete) or as a time measure (e.g. start successor task 1
      week after commencement of the predecessor task). Care
      should be used when assigning a time lag to a sequence
      depending on the setting of the sequence type since there
      is no checking that the time lag value is in keeping with
      the sequence type set.

2631;IfcCostItem;"<EPM-HTML> 

<p>An <i>IfcCostItem</i> describes a cost or financial value together with descriptive information that describes its context in a form that enables it to be used within a cost schedule. An <i>IfcCostItem</i> can be used to represent the cost of goods and services, the execution of works by a process, lifecycle cost and more.</p>

<p>Each instance of <i>IfcCostItem</i> may have a name and a description. Depending on the use for which the cost is intended, these values should be asserted on the basis of agreement. For instance, the <i>Name</i> attribute could be used to provide a common value that enables distinct instances to be brought together in a nesting arrangement (see below) while the </i>Description</i> attribute may be used to provide text used for item description in a costing schedule.</p>

<p>An <i>IfcCostItem</i> can link one or many <i>IfcCostValue</i>'s representing a unit cost, total cost, or a unit cost with one or many quantities used to generate the total cost. The quantities can be given as individual quantities, or those quantities are provided as element quantities by one or many building elements.  The <i>IfcCostValue.CostType</i> attribute indicates the category of cost, which may be used to present the value in a particular column.  For nested cost items (having <i>IfcRelNests</i> relationship), <i>IfcCostValue.CostType</i> is significant such that <i>IfcCostValue.AppliedValue</i> is calculated as the sum of all nested costs having the same <i>IfcCostValue.CostType</i> or if set to an asterisk ('*'), then the sum of all nested costs of all cost types. An <i>IfcCostValue</i> may represent an original value or a value derived from formulas using <i>IfcAppliedValueRelationship</i>.  For example, taxes may be calculated as a percentage of a subtotal.</p>

<blockquote class=""change-ifc2x4"">IFC2x4 CHANGE Attribute <i>PredefinedType</i>, <i>CostValues</i>, and <i>CostQuantities</i> added.</blockquote>

<p><b><u>Classification Use Definition</u></b></p>

<p>Instances of <i>IfcCostItem</i> are used for cost estimates, budgets, and other forms, where a variety of identification codes are used extensively to identify the meaning of the cost. Examples include project phase codes, CSI codes, takeoff sequence numbers, and cost accounts. The model allows for all classes that are ultimately subtypes of <i>IfcObject</i> to inherit the ability to have one or more instances of <i>IfcClassificationReference</i> to be assigned. Where identification codes are required, the generic <i>IfcRelAssociatesClassification</i> facility should be used.</p>


<p><b><u>Composition Use Definition</u></b></p>

<p>An <i>IfcCostItem</i> can nest other instances of <i>IfcCostItem</i> through its relationships to <i>IfcRelNests</i>. This can be used to enable the development of complex groups of costs as may be found in cost schedules through to pages, sections and complete cost schedules.</p>

<p>There is always a summary cost item as the root item of the tree representing the cost item nesting. Subsequent instances of <i>IfcCostItem</i> are assigned to the summary cost item using <i>IfcRelNests</i>.  The summary cost item itself is assigned to <i>IfcCostSchedule</i> through the <i>IfcRelAssignsToControl</i> relationship.</p>

<p>Figure 157 illustrates a cost item composition used for a cost schedule.  Each line item has a quantity and separate unit costs where <i>IfcCostValue.CostType</i> indicates the category of cost.  The summary item has a hierarchy of costs calculated according to <i>IfcAppliedValueRelationship.ArithmeticOperator</i>, where <i>IfcCostValue.CostType</i> identifies the category to be totalled.  The Tax component has <i>IfcCostValue.CostType</i> set to 'Material' which indicates it is the sum of all nested values of the 'Material' category ($3 x 3000 + $118 x 100 = $20800).  The Subtotal component has <i>IfcCostValue.CostType</i> set to an asterisk ('*') which indicates it is the sum of all nested values of all categories.</p>

<p><b><u>Assignment Use Definition</u></b></p>

<p>An <i>IfcCostItem</i> can be calculated based on quantities from objects through its relationship to <i>IfcRelAssignsToControl</i>.</p>

<p>For quantity-based costing, <i>IfcElement</i>, <i>IfcTask</i>, or <i>IfcResource</i> occurrence subtypes may be used.  Multiple elements may be assigned of the same or different types, using <i>IfcPhysicalQuantity</i> entities defined at each object.  Each <i>IfcPhysicalQuantity</i> type must be identical (for example, all values are <i>IfcAreaQuantity</i>) such that they can be added together.<p>

<p>For rate-based costing (specifically for <i>IfcCostScheduleTypeEnum.SCHEDULEOFRATES</i>), a single <i>IfcTypeProduct</i>, <i>IfcTypeProcess</i>, or <i>IfcTypeResource</i> subtype may be used to reflect rates for occurrences of such types.  This enables the possibility to generate a quantity-based cost schedule for occurrences based on types with rate-based cost schedules.</p>

<p><i>IfcRelAssignsToControl</i> is also used in the opposite direction to link the root <i>IfcCostItem</i> to an <i>IfcCostSchedule</i> where <i>RelatingControl</i> is the <i>IfcCostSchedule</i>. 

<p>Figure 158 illustrates cost item assignment derived from building elements.  The <i>IfcRelAssignsToControl</i> relationship indicates building elements for which quantities are derived.  Not shown, costs may also be derived from building elements by traversing assignment relationships from the assigned <i>IfcProduct</i> to <i>IfcProcess</i> to <i>IfcResource</i>, where all costs ultimately originate at resources.  It is also possible for cost items to have assignments from processes or resources directly.</p>

<p><i>IfcConstructionResource</i> is an abstract generalization of the different resources used in
construction projects, mainly labor, material, equipment and product resources, plus subcontracted resources and aggregations such as a crew resource.</p>

<p>A resource represents ""use of something"" and does not necessarily correspond to a single item such as a person or vehicle, but
represents a pool of items having limited availability such as general labor or an equipment fleet. A resource can represent either a generic resource pool (not having any task assignment) or a task-specific resource allocation (having an <i>IfcTask</i>
assignment).</p>

</blockquote>

<p class=""use-head"">Type use definition</p>
<p><i>IfcConstructionResource</i> defines the occurrence of any construction resource; common information about construction resource types is handled by <i>IfcConstructionResourceType</i>. The <i>IfcConstructionResourceType</i> (if present) may establish the common type name, common properties, common cost rates, and common productivities applied to specific task types. The <i>IfcConstructionResourceType</i> is attached using the <i>IfcRelDefinesByType.RelatingType</i> objectified relationship and is accessible by the inverse <i>IsTypedBy</i> attribute as shown in Figure 186.</p>
<p>The resource type may provide shared productivity and cost information, allowing tasks and resources to be selected according to lowest cost and/or shortest duration. Given an <i>IfcProduct</i> of a particular <i>IfcTypeProduct</i> type, an <i>IfcTypeProcess</i> may be selected from those assigned to the product type using <i>IfcRelAssignsToProduct</i>, and an <i>IfcTypeResource</i> may be selected from those assigned to the process type using <i>IfcRelAssignsToProcess</i>. Then <i>IfcTask</i> and <i>IfcConstructionResource</i> occurrences may be instantiated from the type definitions, applying productivitity and rate information to assigned quantities to calculate <i>ResourceTime.ScheduleWork</i>. Task durations can then be calculated by dividing <i>ResourceTime.ScheduleWork</i> by <i>ResourceTime.ScheduleUsage</i>.</p>

<p>Resources may be decomposed into allocation pools using the <i>IfcRelNests</i> relationship as shown in Figure 187. For example, an <i>IfcLaborResource</i> for ""Electrician"" may be decomposed into three task-specific <i>IfcLaborResource</i> objects: ""Electrical Rough-in"", ""First Floor Circuits"", and ""Second Floor Circuits"". Both relating and related sides may represent the same <i>ResourceTime.ScheduleUsage</i> quantity (for example, 6 workers time-shared), or the related side may break out <i>ResourceTime.ScheduleUsage</i> quantities for reserved use (for example, 4 workers and 2 workers).</p> 
<p>A common scenario is two nesting levels where the first-level resources have no task assignments; while second-level resources have specific task assignments indicating that the resource is subdivided into allocations for specific tasks. While the model allows unlimited nesting of resources, implementer agreements may restrict to two nesting levels with task assignments specifically at the second level.</p>

3057;IfcProtectiveDevice;"<p>A protective device breaks an electrical circuit when a stated electric current that passes through it is exceeded.</p>
<p>A protective device provides protection against electrical current only (not as a general protective device). It may be used to represent the complete set of elements including both the tripping unit and the breaking unit that provide the protection. This may be particularly useful at earlier stages of design where the approach to breaking the electrical supply may be determined but the method of tripping may not. Alternatively, this entity may be used to specifically represent the breaking unit alone (in which case the tripping unit will also be specifically identified). This entity is specific to dedicated protective devices and excludes electrical outlets that may have circuit protection.</p>

3593;IfcCoil;"<p>A coil is a device used to provide heat transfer between non-mixing media. A common example is a cooling coil, which utilizes a finned coil in which circulates chilled water, antifreeze, or refrigerant that is used to remove heat from air moving across the surface of the coil. A coil may be used either for heating or cooling purposes by placing a series of tubes (the coil) carrying a heating or cooling fluid into an airstream. The coil may be constructed from tubes bundled in a serpentine form or from finned tubes that give a extended heat transfer surface.</p>
<p>Coils may also be used for non-airflow cases such as embedded in a floor slab.</p>

3601;IfcCooledBeam;"<p>A cooled beam (or chilled beam) is a device typically used to cool air by circulating a fluid such as chilled water through exposed finned tubes above a space. Typically mounted overhead near or within a ceiling, the cooled beam uses convection to cool the space below it by acting as a heat sink for the naturally rising warm air of the space. Once cooled, the air naturally drops back to the floor where the cycle begins again.</p>

<p>An <i>IfcClassification</i> is used for the arrangement of objects into a class or category according to a common purpose or their possession of common
characteristics. A classification in the sense of <i>IfcClassification</i> is taxonomy, or taxonomic scheme, arranged in a hierarchical structure. A category of objects relates to other categories in a generalization-specialization relationship. Therefore the classification items in an
classification are organized in a tree structure.</p>

<p>An <i>IfcResourceConstraintRelationship</i> allows for the
specification of a constraint to be applied to many entity types.
An important case is to apply constraints to properties. The
constraints applied therefore enable a property to carry values
identifying requirements as well as those identifying the
fulfilment of those requirements.</p>

<p>Figure 238 shows how a constraint may be applied to a property within a property set. For simplicity, only the mandatory attributes are shown as asserted. It shows how a property 'ThingWeight' which has a nominal value of 19.5 kg has two constraints that are logically aggregated by an AND connection. One of the constraints has a benchmark of 'GREATERTHANOREQUALTO' whilst the second has a benchmark of 'LESSTHANOREQUALTO'. This means that the constraint must lie between these two bounding values. The relating constraint is instantiated as an objective named as 'Weight Constraint' and qualified as a SPECIFICATION constraint. The two related constraints are both specified as metrics since they can have specific values.</p>

<p>A time series is a set of a time-stamped data entries. It allows a natural association of data collected over intervals of time. Time series can be regular or irregular. In regular time series data arrive predictably at predefined intervals.  In irregular time series  some or all time stamps do not follow a repetitive pattern and unpredictable bursts of data may arrive at unspecified points in time.</p>

<p>The modeling of buildings and their performance involves data that are generated and recorded over a period of time.  Such data cover a large spectrum, from weather data to schedules of all kinds to status measurements to reporting to everything else that has a time related aspect. Their correct placement in time is essential for their proper understanding and use, and the <i>IfcTimeSeries</i> subtypes provide the appropriate data structures to accommodate these types of data.</p>

      An <i>IfcLagTime</i> provides information about the

      optional for a sequence but for work schedules that
      specifically deal with processes occurring at particular
      times, it should be asserted.
    </p>
    <p>
      A lag time has a duration type. This allows the
      identification of whether elapsed time or work time is
      being measured (where work time is the estimate of the time
      required to complete the process and elapsed time being the
      amount of time actually allocated to the process)

      of the schedule. A NOTDEFINED value is also allowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The value of the time lag may be selected as being either a
      percentage ratio or an actual time measure. If selected as
      a ratio, the percentage should apply to the duration of the
      predecessor process (relating process) such that e.g. a
      value of 0.5 (50%) would indicate that the successor task
      should start when the predecessor task is 50% complete (if

      of the duration of the predecessor process to have elapsed
      after the finish of the predecessor process in case of a

<p>The <i>IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage</i> is always assigned to an
individual occurrence object only (i.e. to relevant subtypes of
<i>IfcElement</i>). The <i>IfcMaterialLayerSet</i>, referenced by
<i>ForLayerSet</i> can however be shared among several occurrence
objects. If the element type is available (i.e. the relevant
subtype of <i>IfcElementType</i>, then the
<i>IfcMaterialLayerSet</i> can be assigned to the type object.
The assignment between aÿsubtype of <i>IfcElement</i> and the
<i>IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage</i> is handled by
<i>IfcRelAssociatesMaterial</i>.</p>

<p class=""use-head"">Use definition</p>
<p>The <i>IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage</i> is primarily intended to
be associated with planar building elements having a constant
thickness. With further agreements on the interpretation of
<i>LayerSetDirection</i>, the usage can be extended also to other
cases, e.g. to curved building elements, provided that the
material layer thicknesses are constant.</p>
<p>Generally, an element may be layered in any of its primary
directions, denoted by its x, y or z axis. The geometry use
definitions at eachÿspecific types of building element will
determine the applicableÿ<i>LayerSetDirection</i>.</p>

<p>The following examples illustrate how the <i>IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage</i> attributes (LayerSetDirection, DirectionSense, OffsetFromReferenceLine) can
be used in different cases. The normative material use definitions are documented at each element (how these shall be used).</p>

<p>Figure 286 shows an example of the use of <i>IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage</i> aligned to the axis of a wall.</p>

<blockquote><small>EXAMPLE&nbsp; For a standard wall with extruded
geometric representation (vertical extrusion), the layer set
direction will be perpendicular to extrusion direction,
andÿ</small><small>can be derived from the direction of the wall
axis. With the <i>DirectionSense</i></small><small>(positive in
this example) the individual <i>IfcMaterialLayers</i> are
assigned consecutively right-to-left or left-to-right. For a
curved wall, ""direction denoting the wall thickness"" can be
derived from the direction of the wall axis, and it will remain
perpendicular to the wall path.</small> <small>The
<i>DirectionSense</i></small><small><i>ÿ</i>applies as well.<br>
<br>
NOTE&nbsp; According to the <i>IfcWallStandardCase</i> material use
definition the <i>LayerSetDirection</i> for
<i>IfcWallStandardCase</i> is always AXIS2 (i.e. along the
y-axis), as shown in this example.</small></blockquote>

<p><i>IfcMaterialUsageDefinition</i> is a general supertype for all

<p>There are two ways of assigning a set of materials with shape

<li>a layer set to a reference curve - assigning a material layer
set with material layers having a sequence and thickness
parameter to a reference curve of an element - represented by the
'Axis' shape representation of that element</li>
<li>a profile set to a cardinal point - assigning a material
profile set with assigned profile geometry and insertion points
to a reference curve by an offset, called ""cardinal point"" - the
reference curve is represented by the 'Axis' shape representation
of that element</li>
</ul>
<p>Each instantiable subtype of <i>IfcMaterialUsageDefinition</i>

<blockquote>
  <p>Each vertex-based geometry node uses a set of 2D texture
coordinates that map textures to vertices. Texture map values (
ImageTexture, PixelTexture) range from [0.0, 1.0] along the S-axis and
T-axis. However, texture coordinate values may be in the range
(-&infin;,&infin;). Texture coordinates identify a location
(and thus a
colour value) in the texture map. The horizontal coordinate S is
specified first, followed by the vertical coordinate T. If the texture
map is repeated in a given direction (S-axis or T-axis), a texture
coordinate C (s or t) is mapped into a texture map that has N pixels in
the given direction as follows: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <pre><b>Texture map location = (C - floor(C)) &times; N<br>			 </b></pre>
  </blockquote>
  <p>If the texture map is not
repeated, the texture coordinates are
clamped to the 0.0 to 1.0 range as follows: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <pre><b>Texture map location = N,     if C &gt; 1.0,<br>                     = 0.0,   if C &lt; 0.0,<br>                     = C &times; N, if 0.0 &le; C &le; 1.0.</b>

<p><b>Use in material association</b></p>

<p>Beams, columns, and similarly shaped building elements and their type objects may
be associated with a section profile definition, combined with material definition,
by means of <i>IfcRelAssociatesMaterial</i> together with <i>IfcMaterialProfileSet</i>
and <i>IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage</i>. This way, building elements and element types
with same section and material can share a common section profile definition and
association.</p>

<p>The profile definition in material association is required to be consistent with
shape representations of the respective building elements.</p>

<p>A higher-level description of spatial aligment of the section profile of a member
(such as centered, bottom-left, in the geometric centroid, and more) can be provided
within <i>IfcMaterialProfileSetUsage</i> by means of a cardinal point reference.
This can be used redundant to geometric data in order to convey design intent.</p>


<p><b>Use in shape models</b></p>

<p>Profile definitions are used within the geometry and geometric model
resource to create either swept surfaces, swept area solids, or
sectioned spines.</p>

<p>The purpose of the profile
definition within the swept surfaces or swept area solids is to define
a uniform cross section being swept:</p>

<ul>
  <li>along a line (extrusion) using <i>IfcSurfaceOfLinearExtrusion</i> or <i>IfcExtrudedAreaSolid</i></li>
  <li>along a circular arc (revolution) using <i>IfcSurfaceOfRevolution</i> or <i>IfcRevolvedAreaSolid</i></li>
  <li>along a directrix lying on a reference surface using <i>IfcSurfaceCurveSweptAreaSolid</i></li>
</ul>

<p>The purpose fo the profile
definition within the sectioned spine is to define a varying cross
sections at several positions along a spine curve. The subtype <i>IfcDerivedProfileDef</i>
is particularly suited to provide the consecutive profiles to be based
on transformations of the start profile and thus maintaining the
identity of vertices and edges.</p>

<blockquote class=""note"">
NOTE&nbsp; Subtypes of the <i>IfcProfileDef</i>

which establish their own 2D position coordinate system, profiles given
by explicit curve geometry (either open or closed profiles) and two
special types for composite profiles and derived profiles, based on a

<p>An <i>IfcProfileDef</i>
is treated as bounded area if it is used within swept area solids. In
this case, the inside of the profile is part of the profile. The
attribute <i>ProfileType</i> is set to AREA. An <i>IfcProfileDef</i>
is treated as a curve if it is used within swept surfaces. In this
case, the inside of the profile (if the curve is closed) is not part of
the profile. The attribute <i>ProfileType</i>
is set to CURVE.</p>

<p><b>Profile specification by external reference</b></p>

<p>If the profile is standardized by a norm or a catalogue, a reference
to this norm or catalogue should be provided by means of <i>HasExternalReference</i>.
This inverse relationship is used to associate an <i>IfcExternalReference</i> (notably
<i>IfcClassificationReference</i> or <i>IfcLibraryReference</i>) with the
profile.</p>

<p><i>IfcClassificationReference</i> is used to refer to a profile norm (a common standard or
manufacturer's standard).  In this case,</p>
<ul>
<li><i>IfcClassificationReference.ItemReference</i>
contains the formal profile designation from the norm.
(On the other hand, <i>IfcProfileDef.ProfileName</i> contains a displayable name which may
not necessarily be the same as the formal designation.)</li>
<li><i>IfcClassificationReference.Name</i> carries the short name of the profile norm.</li>
<li>Optionally, the norm can be further described by
<i>IfcClassificationReference.ReferencedSource</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>IfcLibraryReference</i> is used to refer to a library which contains profile
definitions. In this case,</p>
<ul>
<li><i>IfcLibraryReference.ItemReference</i> contains the identifier of the
profile within the library and is meant to be machine-readable (in contrast to
<i>IfcProfileDef.ProfileName</i> which should be human-readable).</li>
<li><i>IfcLibraryReference.Location</i> and <i>.Name</i> or <i>.ReferencedLibrary</i>
further describe the library.</li>
</ul>

<p>If an external reference is provided, sending systems shall ensure that
the shape of the profile definition object agrees with the definitions in the
referenced classification or library.</p>



<p><b>Direct instances of <i>IfcProfileDef</i></b></p>

<p>Usually, only subtypes of <i>IfcProfileDef</i> should be instantiated.
In some special cases, e.g. if the profile object is used for purposes
other than geometric models (e.g. for structural analysis models), it may be
possible to directly instantiate <i>IfcProfileDef</i> and further specify
the profile only by external reference or by profile properties. The latter
are tracked by the inverse attribute <i>HasProperties</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>IfcMirroredProfileDef</i> defines the profile by mirroring the parent profile about the y axis of the parent profile coordinate system. That is, left and right of the parent profile are swapped.</p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<p><i>IfcMirroredProfileDef</i> is primarily useful together with
<i>IfcCShapeProfileDef</i>, <i>IfcLShapeProfileDef</i>,
<i>IfcUShapeProfileDef</i>, or <i>IfcZShapeProfileDef</i> as
parent profile but can be used with other parent profile types as well.</p>

<p>Mirroring of an <i>IfcParameterizedProfileDef</i> is performed after
translation and rotation according to its <i>Position</i> attribute.
For example, if the parent profile's <i>Position</i> offsets it by half
of its width to the right, then the mirrored profile will be offset by
half of its width to the left.</p>

<p>Mirroring about the x axis, i.e. swapping top and bottom, can be
achieved by mirroring about the y axis coupled with 180 degree rotation
about the z axis.
In general, rotation happens in a containing object such as
<i>IfcSweptAreaSolid</i>, i.e. after mirroring by <i>IfcMirroredProfileDef</i>
was performed.
If the parent profile is an <i>IfcParameterizedProfileDef</i>, rotation
can alternatively happen already in the parent profile by means of its
<i>Position</i> attribute, i.e. before mirroring by <i>IfcMirroredProfileDef</i>
was performed.</p>

<p><u>Definition from ISO/CD 10303-42:1992</u>: A Boolean result
is the result of a regularized operation on two solids to create
a new solid. Valid operations are regularized union, regularized
intersection, and regularized difference. For purpose of Boolean
operations, a solid is considered to be a regularized set of
points. The final Boolean result depends upon the operation and
the two operands. In the case of the difference operator the
order of the operands is also significant. The operator can be
either union, intersection or difference. The effect of these
operators is described below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Union on two solids is the new solid that is the
regularization of the set of all points that are in either the
first operand or the second operand or in both.</li>
<li>Intersection on two solids is the new solid that is the
regularization of the set of all points that are in both the
first operand and the second operand.</li>
<li>The result of the difference operation on two solids is the

operand, but not in the second operand.</li>

<p><u>Definition from ISO/CD 10303-42:1992</u>: A manifold solid
B-rep is a finite, arcwise connected volume bounded by one or
more surfaces, each of which is a connected, oriented, finite,
closed 2-manifold. There is no restriction on the genus of the
volume, nor on the number of voids within the volume.</p>
<p>The Boundary Representation (B-rep) of a manifold solid
utilizes a graph of edges and vertices embedded in a connected,
oriented, finite, closed two manifold surface. The embedded graph
divides the surface into arcwise connected areas known as faces.
The edges and vertices, therefore, form the boundaries of the
face and the domain of a face does not include its boundaries.
The embedded graph may be disconnected and may be a pseudo graph.
The graph is labeled; that is, each entity in the graph has a
unique identity. The geometric surface definition used to specify
the geometry of a face shall be 2-manifold embeddable in the
plane within the domain of the face. In other words, it shall be
connected, oriented, finite, non-self-intersecting, and of
surface genus 0.</p>
<p>Faces do not intersect except along their boundaries. Each
edge along the boundary of a face is shared by at most one other
face in the assemblage. The assemblage of edges in the B-rep do
not intersect except at their boundaries (i.e., vertices). The
geometry curve definition used to specify the geometry of an edge
shall be arcwise connected and shall not self intersect or
overlap within the domain of the edge. The geometry of an edge
shall be consistent with the geometry of the faces of which it
forms a partial bound. The geometry used to define a vertex shall
be consistent with the geometry of the faces and edges of which
it forms a partial bound.</p>
<p>A B-rep is represented by one or more closed shells which
shall be disjoint. One shell, the outer, shall completely enclose
all the other shells and no other shell may enclose a shell. The
facility to define a B-rep with one or more internal voids is
provided by a subtype. The following version of the Euler formula
shall be satisfied, where V, E, F, L<sub>l</sub> and S are the
numbers of unique vertices, edges, faces, loop uses and shells in
the model and G<sup>s</sup> is the sum of the genus of the
shells.</p>

which is the result of sweeping a surface along a
<em>Directrix</em>. The orientation of the curve during the
sweeping operation is controlled by the <em>FixedReference</em>
direction.</p>
<p>The <em>SweptArea</em> is required to be a curve bounded surface
lying in the plane z = 0 and this is swept along the
<em>Directrix</em> in such a way that the origin of the local
coordinate system used to define the <em>SweptArea</em> is on the
<em>Directrix</em> and the local X axis is in the direction of the
projection of <em>FixedReference</em> onto the normal plane to the
directrix at this point. The resulting solid has the property that
the cross section of the surface by the normal plane to the

      <u>Definition from ISO/CD 10303-42:1992</u>: A solid
      represented as a CSG model is defined by a collection of
      so-called primitive solids, combined using regularized
      Boolean operations. The allowed operations are
      intersection, union, and difference. As a special case a
      CSG solid can also consists of a single CSG primitive.
    </p>
    <p>
      A CSG solid requires two kinds of information for its
      complete definition: geometric and structural.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The geometric information is conveyed by solid models.
      These typically primitive volumes such as cylinders, wedges
      and extrusions, but can include general B-Rep models. Solid
      models can also be half space solids.
      </li>
      <li>The structural information is in a tree (strictly an
      acyclic directed graph) of Boolean result and CSG solids,
      which represent a &#8216;recipe&#8217; for building the
      solid. The terminal nodes are the geometric primitives and
      other solids. Every CSG solid has precisely one Boolean
      result associated with it which is the root of the tree
      that defines the solid. (There may be further Boolean
      results within the tree as operands). The significance of a
      CSG solid entity is that the solid defined by the
      associated tree is thus identified as a significant object
      itself, and in this way it is distinguished from other
      Boolean result entities representing intermediate results
      during the construction process.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <u>Definition from IAI</u>: The following primitive volumes
      can be parts of the CSG tree: solid models, i.e. faceted
      B-Rep (<i>IfcFacetedBrep, IfcFacetedBrepWithVoids</i>),
      swept area solid (<i>IfcExtrudedAreaSolid,
      IfcRevolvedAreaSolid, IfcSurfaceCurveSweptAreaSolid</i>),
      swept disk solids (<i>IfcSweptDiskSolid</i>), half space

A trimmed curve is a bounded curve which is created by taking a selected

The basis curve itself is unaltered and more than one trimmed curve may
reference the same basis curve. Trimming points for the curve may be
identified by:</p>
<ul> <li> parametric value </li> <li>geometric
position </li> <li>both of the above </li>
</ul><p>At least one of these shall be specified at each
end of the
curve. The <i>SenseAgreement</i> makes it possible to
unambiguously define any segment of a closed curve such as a circle.
The combinations of sense and ordered end points make it possible to
define four distinct directed segments connecting two different points
on a circle or other closed curve. For this purpose cyclic properties
of the parameter range are assumed; for example, 370 degrees is
equivalent to 10 degrees. </p>
<p>The <i>IfcTrimmedCurve</i> has a parameterization
which is inherited from the particular basis curve reference. More
precisely the parameter s of the trimmed curve is derived from the
parameter of the basis curve as follows: </p>
<ul> <li>if <i>SenseAgreement</i> is TRUE: <i>s
= t - t<sub>1</sub></i></li> <li> if <i>SenseAgreement</i>
is FALSE: <i>s
= t<sub>2</sub> - t</i> </li>

the value
given by <i>Trim1</i> or the parameter value corresponding
to point 1 and t<sub>2</sub> is the value given by <i>Trim2</i>
or the parameter value corresponding to point 2. The resultant <i>IfcTrimmedCurve</i>
has a parameter ranging from 0 at the first trimming point to |t<sub>2</sub>
- t<sub>1</sub>| at the second trimming point. </p>
