2045;SelfWeightCoefficients;"<EPM-HTML>

The self weight coefficients specify ratios at which loads due to weight of members shall be included in the load case.  These loads are not explicitly modeled as instances of <i>IfcStructuralAction</i>.  Instead they shall be calculated according to geometry, section, and material of each member.

<p>The three components of the self weight vector correspond with the x,y,z directions of the so-called global coordinates, i.e. the directions of the shared <i>ObjectPlacement</i> of all items in an <i>IfcStructuralAnalysisModel</i>.  For example, if the object placement defines a z axis which is upright like the <i>IfcProject</i>'s world coordinate system, then the self weight coefficients would typically be [0.,0.,-1.] in a load case of dead loads with self weight.</p>

<p>The overall coefficient in the inherited attribute <i>Coefficient</i> shall not be applied to <i>SelfWeightCoefficients</i> of the same instance of <i>IfcStructuralLoadCase</i>.  It only applies to actions and load groups which are grouped below the load case, not to the load case's computed self weight.

2091;GlobalOrLocal;"<EPM-HTML>

an explicit or implied representation and its parameter space).

<blockquote><font size=""-1"">NOTE, the informal definition of

not be the same as the project-wide world coordinate system.</font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font size=""-1"">In the scope of <i>IfcStructuralActivity.GlobalOrLocal</i>,
the meaning of GLOBAL_COORDS is therefore not to be taken as world coordinate system

Orientation of the material layer set relative to element reference geometry. The meaning of the value of this attribute shall be specified in the geometry use section for each element. For extruded shape representation, direction can be given along the extrusion path (e.g. for slabs) or perpendicular to it (e.g. for walls).

<blockquote>
  <small>NOTE&nbsp; the <i>LayerSetDirection</i> for <i>IfcWallStandardCase</i> shall be AXIS2 (i.e. the y-axis) and for <i>IfcSlabStandardCase</i> and <i>IfcPlateStandardCase</i> it shall be AXIS3 (i.e. the z-axis).

Whether the material layers of the set being used shall 'grow' into the positive or negative direction of the given axis, shall be deifned by <i>DirectionSense</i> attribute.
</EPM-HTML>"
4283;DirectionSense;"<EPM-HTML>
Denotion whether the material layer set is oriented in positive or negative sense along the specified axis (defined by LayerSetDirection). ""Positive"" means that the consecutive layers (the <i>IfcMaterialLayer</i> instances in the list of <i> IfcMaterialLayerSet.MaterialLayers</i>) are placed face-by-face in the direction of the positive axis as established by LayerSetDirection: for AXIS2 it would be in +y, for AXIS3 it would be +z. ""Negative"" means that the layers are placed face-by-face in the direction of the negative LayerSetDirection. In both cases,  starting at the material layer set base line.
<blockquote><small>NOTE&nbsp; the material layer set base line (MlsBase) is located by OffsetFromReferenceLine, and may be on the positive or negative side of the element reference line (or plane); positive or negative for MlsBase placement does not depend on the DirectionSense attribute, but on the relevant element axis.</small></blockquote>

4284;OffsetFromReferenceLine;"<EPM-HTML>
Offset of the material layer set base line (MlsBase) from reference geometry (line or plane) of element. The offset can be positive or negative, unless restricted for a particular building element type in its use definition or by implementer agreement. A positive value means, that the MlsBase is placed on the positive side of the reference line or plane, on the axis established by LayerSetDirection (in case of AXIS2 into the direction of +y, or in case of AXIS2 into the direction of +z). A negative value means that the MlsBase is placed on the negative side, as established by LayerSetDirection (in case of AXIS2 into the direction of -y). <blockquote><small>NOTE&nbsp; the positive or negative sign in the offset only affects the MlsBase placement, it does not have any effect on the application of DirectionSense for orientation of the material layers; also DirectionSense does not change the MlsBase placement.

Definition from VRML97 - ISO/IEC 14772-1:1997: The cutOffAngle (name of spread angle in VRML) field specifies the outer bound of the solid angle. The light source does not emit light outside of this solid angle."
5004;BeamWidthAngle;"Definition from VRML97 - ISO/IEC 14772-1:1997: The beamWidth field specifies an inner solid angle in which the light source emits light at uniform full intensity.

Often the values are only approximate color temperatures as the black-body radiator cannot emit radiation of every chromaticity value. The color temperatures of the commonest artificial light sources range from less than 3000K (warm white) to 4000K (intermediate) and over 5000K (daylight)."
5009;LuminousFlux;"Luminous flux is a photometric measure of radiant flux, i.e. the volume of light emitted from a light source. Luminous flux is measured either for the interior as a whole or for a part of the interior (partial luminous flux for a solid angle).
