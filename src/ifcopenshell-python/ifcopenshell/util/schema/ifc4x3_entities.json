A closed shell has no boundary, and has non-zero finite extent. If the shell has a domain with coordinate space R3, it divides that space into two connected regions, one finite and the other infinite. In this case, the topological normal of the shell is defined as being directed from the finite to the infinite region.\n>\n> The shell is represented by a collection of faces. The domain of the shell, if present, contains all those faces, together with their bounds. Associated with each face in the shell is a logical value which indicates whether the face normal agrees with (TRUE) or is opposed to (FALSE) the shell normal. The logical value can be applied directly as a BOOLEAN attribute of an oriented face, or be defaulted to TRUE if the shell boundary attribute member is a face without the orientation attribute.\n>\n> The combinatorial restrictions on closed shells and geometrical restrictions on their domains are designed to ensure that any domain associated with a closed shell is a closed, orientable manifold. The domain of a closed shell, if present, is a connected, closed, oriented 2-manifold. It is always topologically equivalent to an H-fold torus for some H &ge; 0. The number H is referred to as the surface genus of the shell.
