    """Add a new profile item to a profile set

    A profile item in a profile set represents an extruded 2D profile curve
    that is extruded along the axis of the element. Most commonly there will
    only be a single profile item in a profile set. For example, a beam will
    have a material profile set containing a single profile item, which may
    have a steel material and a I-beam shaped profile curve.

    Note that the "profile item" represents a single extrusion in the
    profile set, whereas the "profile curve" represents a 2D curve used by a
    "profile item".

    In some cases, a profiled element (i.e. beam, column) may be a composite
    beam or column and include multiple extrusions. This is rare. The order
    of the profiles does not matter.

    :param profile_set: The IfcMaterialProfileSet that the profile is part of. The
        profile set represents a group of profile items. See
        ifcopenshell.api.material.add_material_set for more information on
        how to add a profile set.
    :type profile_set: ifcopenshell.entity_instance
    :param material: The IfcMaterial that the profile item is made out of.
    :type material: ifcopenshell.entity_instance, optional
    :param profile: The IfcProfileDef that represents the 2D cross section
        of the the profile item.
    :type profile: ifcopenshell.entity_instance, optional
    :return: The newly created IfcMaterialProfile
    :rtype: ifcopenshell.entity_instance

    Example:

    .. code:: python

        # Let's imagine we have a steel I-beam. Notice we are assigning to
        # the type only, as all occurrences of that type will automatically
        # inherit the material.
        beam_type = ifcopenshell.api.root.create_entity(model, ifc_class="IfcBeamType", name="B1")

        # item. If this were a composite beam, we might add multiple profile
        # items instead, but this is rarely the case in most construction.
