class Usecase:
    def __init__(self, file, material=None, element=None):
        """Copies a material to an element

        This convenience function exists to allow you to easily unassign any
        existing material an element has, and assign a new material to it.
        Essentially, it is a form a copy / pasting a material from one element
        to another.

        It's a bit out of place, and will likely be redesigned or removed in the
        future.  It's not recommended to use this function, and
        ifcopenshell.api.material.assign_material should be used instead.

        :param material: The IfcMaterial to assign to the element.
        :type material: ifcopenshell.entity_instance.entity_instance
        :param element: The IfcElement or IfcElementType to remove all previous
            materials from and assign the new material to.
        :type element: ifcopenshell.entity_instance.entity_instance
        :return: None
        :rtype: None

        Example:

        .. code:: python

            concrete = ifcopenshell.api.run("material.add_material", model, name="CON01", category="concrete")
            wood = ifcopenshell.api.run("material.add_material", model, name="TIM01", category="wood")

            # Let's imagine a concrete bench made out of concrete.
            bench = ifcopenshell.api.run("root.create_entity", model, ifc_class="IfcFurniture")
            ifcopenshell.api.run("material.assign_material", model,
                product=bench, type="IfcMaterial", material=concrete)

            # And some street furniture made from wood.
            street_furniture = ifcopenshell.api.run("root.create_entity", model, ifc_class="IfcFurniture")
            ifcopenshell.api.run("material.assign_material", model,
