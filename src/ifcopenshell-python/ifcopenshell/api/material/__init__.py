"""Manage physical materials (concrete, steel, etc) and their association to
elements

IFC supports both simple materials and parametric materials (materials that
have layered thicknesses or cross sectional profiles).

Parametric materials will include parametric constraints on the geometry of
the element. These API functions do not cover that responsibility. See
:mod:`ifcopenshell.api.geometry`.

Note that this API only covers physical materials, not visual styles. If you
want to look at visual styles such as colours, transparency, shading, or
rendering options, see :mod:`ifcopenshell.api.style`.
