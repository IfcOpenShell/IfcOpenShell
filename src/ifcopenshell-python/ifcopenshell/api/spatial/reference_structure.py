    """Denote that a list products is related to a list of spatial structures

    This is similar to ifcopenshell.api.spatial.assign_container, except
    that containment can only occur between a product and a single spatial
    structure element. This is fine if a wall is on level 1, but not
    appropriate if you have a multistorey column on multiple levels, or a
    door with a to and from space, or a stair going from one floor to
    another floor. This is where spatial referencing is used.

    Typically, the product will be contained in the lowermost, constructed
    first, or primarily accessible space. For a multistorey column or stair,
    the column or stair will therefore be contained in the lowermost storey.
    Then, any other storeys will be referenced.

    Referencing is non-hierarchical, so a door may be referenced in multiple
    spaces simultaneously.

    :param products: The list of physical IfcElements that exists in the space.

    :param relating_structure: The IfcSpatialStructureElement element, such
        as IfcBuilding, IfcBuildingStorey, or IfcSpace that the element
        exists in.
    :type relating_structure: ifcopenshell.entity_instance
    :return: The IfcRelReferencedInSpatialStructure relationship instance
        or `None` if `products` was an empty list.
