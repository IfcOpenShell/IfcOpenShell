    Structural loads may be actions or reactions. A simple load might be a
    static and be linear, planar, or a single point. Alternatively, loads
    may be defined as a configuration of multiple loads.

    :param name: The name of the load
    :type name: str,optional
    :param ifc_class: The subtype of IfcStructuralLoad to create. Consult
        the IFC documentation to see all the types of loads.
    :type ifc_class: str
    :return: The newly created load entity, depending on the ifc_class
        specified.
    :rtype: ifcopenshell.entity_instance

    Example:

    .. code:: python

        # Create a simple linear load
        ifcopenshell.api.run("structural.add_structural_load", model)
    """
