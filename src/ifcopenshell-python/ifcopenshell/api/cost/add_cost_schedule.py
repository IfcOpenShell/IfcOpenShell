        A cost schedule is a group of cost items which typically represent a
        cost plan or breakdown of the project. This may be used as an estimate,
        bid, or actual cost.

        Alternatively, a cost schedule may also represent a schedule of rates,
        which include cost items which capture unit rates for different elements
        or processes.

        As such, creating a cost schedule is necessary prior to creating and
        managing any cost items.

        :param name: The name of the cost schedule.
        :type name: str, optional
        :param predefined_type: The predefined type of the cost schedule, chosen
            from a valid type in the IFC documentation for
            IfcCostScheduleTypeEnum
        :type predefined_type: str, optional
        :return: The newly created IfcCostSchedule entity
        :rtype: ifcopenshell.entity_instance.entity_instance

        Example:

        .. code:: python

            schedule = ifcopenshell.api.run("cost.add_cost_schedule", model)
            # Now that we have a cost schedule, we may add cost items to it
