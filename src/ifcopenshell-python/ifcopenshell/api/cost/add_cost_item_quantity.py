    """Adds a new quantity associated with a cost item

    Cost items calculate their subtotal by multiplying the sum of the cost
    item's "values" by the sum of the cost item's "quantities". The
    quantities may be either parametrically linked to quantities measured on
    physical product, or manually specified.

    The quantity must be of a particular type, common examples are:

    - IfcQuantityCount: to count the total occurrences of a product, useful
      for things like doors, windows, and furniture
    - IfcQuantityNumber: any other generic numeric quantity
    - IfcQuantityLength
    - IfcQuantityArea
    - IfcQuantityVolume
    - IfcQuantityWeight
    - IfcQuantityTime

    A cost item must not mix quantities of different types.

    If an IfcQuantityCount is used, then this API will automatically count
    all products that this cost item controls (see
    ifcopenshell.api.controls.assign_control) and prefill that quantity.

    For all other quantity types, the quantity is left as zero and the user
    must either manually specify the quantity or parametrically link it
    using another API call.

    :param cost_item: The IfcCostItem to add the quantity to
    :type cost_item: ifcopenshell.entity_instance
    :param ifc_class: The type of quantity to add
    :type ifc_class: str, optional
    :return: The newly created quantity entity, chosen from the ifc_class
        parameter

        # Let's assume we want to count the amount of chairs to calculate our cost item
