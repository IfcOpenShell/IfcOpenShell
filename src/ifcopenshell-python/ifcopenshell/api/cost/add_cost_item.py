    A cost item represents a single line item in a cost schedule. Cost items
    may then be broken down into cost subitems.

    Either `cost_schedule` or `cost_item` must be provided.

    :param cost_schedule: If the cost item is to be added as a root or top
        level cost item to a cost schedule, the IfcCostSchedule may be
        specified. This is mutually exlclusive to the cost_item parameter.
    :type cost_schedule: ifcopenshell.entity_instance, optional.
    :param cost_item: If the cost item is to be added as a subitem to an
        existing cost item, the parent IfcCostItem may be specified. This is
        mutually exclusive to the cost_schedule parameter.
    :type cost_item: ifcopenshell.entity_instance, optional
