    """Assigns a document to a list of products

    An object may be assigned to zero, one, or multiple documents. Almost
    any object or property may be assigned to a document, though typically
    we'd only use it for spaces, types, physical products and schedules.
    Adding a new assignment is typically done using a document reference and
    an object.  IFC technically allows association with a document
    information and an object, but this is not encouraged because it is not
    consistent with other external relationships (such as classification
    systems or libraries).

    :param product: The list of objects to associate the document to. This could be
        almost any sensible object in IFC.
    :type product: list[ifcopenshell.entity_instance]
    :param document: The IfcDocumentReference to associate to, or
        alternatively an IfcDocumentInformation, though this is not
        recommended.
    :type document: ifcopenshell.entity_instance
    :return: The IfcRelAssociatesDocument relationship
        or `None` if `products` was an empty list or all products were
        already assigned to the `document`.
    :rtype: ifcopenshell.entity_instance

    Example:

    .. code:: python

        document = ifcopenshell.api.document.add_information(model)
        ifcopenshell.api.document.edit_information(model,
            information=document,
            attributes={"Identification": "A-GA-6100", "Name": "Overall Plan",
            "Location": "A-GA-6100 - Overall Plan.pdf"})
        reference = ifcopenshell.api.document.add_reference(model, information=document)

        # Let's imagine storey represents an IfcBuildingStorey for the ground floor
