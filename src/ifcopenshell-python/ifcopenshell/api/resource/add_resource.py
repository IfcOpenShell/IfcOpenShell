    """Add a new construction resource

    Construction resources may be managed and connected to cost schedules
    and construction schedules. This allows calculations to be done on
    resource utilisation, cost optimisation (e.g. labour rates), and
    optioneering on build strategies.

    There are typically two types of resources. Crew resources are resources
    where you manage your own crew and you have full control over the
    equipment, labour, products, and materials used by your crew.
    Alternatively, there are subcontractor resources, where you simply
    delegate all the details to a subcontractor and it is not decomposed
    into further levels of detail.

    This means when adding resources, you'd first either add a crew or
    subcontract resource. If it is a crew resource, you'd then add child
    resources to that crew, such as equipment (cranes, excavators, hoists,
    etc), material (wood, concrete, etc), and labour (rigging crews,
    formworkers, etc).

    :param parent_resource: If this is a child resource (typically to a crew
        resource), then nominate the parent IfcConstructionResource here.
    :type parent_resource: ifcopenshell.entity_instance, optional
    :param ifc_class: The class of resource chosen from
        IfcConstructionEquipmentResource, IfcConstructionMaterialResource,
        IfcConstructionProductResource, IfcCrewResource, IfcLaborResource,
        or IfcSubContractResource.
    :type ifc_class: str,optional
    :param name: The name of the resource
    :type name: str,optional
    :param predefined_type: Consult the IFC documentation for the valid
        predefined types for each type of resource class.
    :type predefined_type: str,optional
    :return: The newly created resource depending on the nominated IFC
        class.
