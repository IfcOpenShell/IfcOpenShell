    """Assigns a resource to an object

    Two types of objects are typically assigned to resources: products and
    actors.

    If a product is assigned to a resource, that means that the product
    represents the resource on site. This may be represented via material
    handling zones on a construction site, or equipment like cranes and
    their physical locations.

    If an actor is assigned to a resource, that means that the actor (person
    or organisation) is the actor consuming the resource (e.g. if the
    resource is material or equipment) or the actor performing the work
    (e.g. if the resource is a labour resource).

    :param relating_resource: The IfcResource to assign the object to.
    :type relating_resource: ifcopenshell.entity_instance
    :param related_object: The IfcProduct or IfcActor to assign to the
        object.
    :type related_object: ifcopenshell.entity_instance
    :return: The newly created IfcRelAssignsToResource
    :rtype: ifcopenshell.entity_instance

            parent_resource=crew, ifc_class="IfcConstructionEquipmentResource", name="Tower Crane 01")

        # Our tower crane will be placed via this physical product.
        product = ifcopenshell.api.root.create_entity(model,
            ifc_class="IfcBuildingElementProxy", predefined_type="CRANE")
