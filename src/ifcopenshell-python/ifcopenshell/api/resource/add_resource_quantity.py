    """Adds a quantity to a resource

    The quantity of a resource represents the "unit quantity" of that
    resource. For example, labour might be hired on a daily basis (8 hours).
    There are different types of quantities (e.g. volume, count, or time).
    Which quantity is used depends on the type of resource.  Material
    resources may be quantified in terms of length, area, volume, or weight.
    Equipment and labour resources are quantified in terms of time. Products
    resources are quantified in terms of counts.

    This base quantity is then used in other calculations.

    :param resource: The IfcConstructionResource to add a quantity to.
    :type resource: ifcopenshell.entity_instance
    :param ifc_class: The type of quantity to add, chosen from
        IfcQuantityArea (for material), IfcQuantityCount (for products),
        IfcQuantityLength (for material), IfcQuantityTime (for equipment or
        labour), IfcQuantityVolume (for material), and IfcQuantityWeight
        (for material).
    :type ifc_class: str,optional
    :return: The newly created quantity depending on the IFC class
