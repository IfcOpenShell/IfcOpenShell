        This is an unofficial parametric calculation that may be done on a
        resource based on careful analysis of the relationships between the
        costing, scheduling, and resource domains in IFC.

        A resource may store a productivity rate in a property set called
        EPset_Productivity. This stores three properties:

        * BaseQuantityConsumed - a duration that the resource is consumed for.
        * BaseQuantityProducedName - what quantity the resource can produce,
            such as area or volume.
        * BaseQuantityProducedValue - what value of that quantity the resource
            can produce during that duration.

        For example, a labour or equipment resource might produce 100m3 of
        NetVolume every day (i.e. 8 hours are consumed).

        Then, if a resource is assigned to a construction task, and that
        construction task is assigned to concrete slabs totalling 200m3, we can
        calculate that the resource consumes 16 hours of work.

        This calculated work is stored against the resource as scheduled work
        under the resource time data.

        :param resource: The IfcConstructionResource that you want to calculate
            the work performed.
