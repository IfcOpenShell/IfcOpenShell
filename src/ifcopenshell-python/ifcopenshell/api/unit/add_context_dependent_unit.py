    """Add a new arbitrary unit that can only be interpreted in a project specific context

    Occasionally the construction industry uses arbitrary units to quantify
    objects, like "pairs" of door hardware, "palettes" or "boxes" of fixings
    or equipment.

    :param unit_type: Typically should be left as USERDEFINED, unless for
        some bizarre reason you are redefining something you could use a
        sensible normal unit for. In that case, firstly stop whatever you're
        doing and have a hard think about your life, and then if life really
        is going that badly for you, check out the IFC docs for IfcUnitEnum.
    :type unit_type: str
    :param name: Give your unit a name. X what? X bananas?
    :type name: str
    :param dimensions: Units typically measure one of 7 fundamental physical
        dimensions: length, mass, time, electric current, temperature,
        substance amount, or luminous intensity. These are represented as a
        list of 7 integers, representing the exponents of each one of these
        dimensions. For example, a length unit is (1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),
        where as an area unit is (2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0). A unit of meters per
        second is (1, 0, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0). For context dependent units, it is
        recommended to leave this as the default of (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0).
