    """Adds a new grid axis to a grid

    An IFC grid will typically have a minimum of two axes which will be
    perpendicular to one another. Grids may be rectangular (typically
    perpendicular lines), radial (where one set of axes is a circle and the
    other is a line), or triangular (three sets of axes, each at a different
    angle to one another).

    For a simple rectangular grid, the "UAxes" are a set of one or more
    horizontal axes, which are typically labeled with the convention of A,
    B, C, etc. The "VAxes" is another set of one or more vertical axes,
    typically labeled with the convention of 1, 2, 3, etc. These axes are
    horizontal or vertical relative to project north.

    For a radial grid, the "UAxes" are straight lines, typically radiating
    from a central point. The "VAxes" are circular perimeters, with the
    center of these circles being the same central point.

    For a triangular grid, the UAxes, VAxes, and WAxes are all sets of one
    or more straight lines.

    :param axis_tag: The name of the axis, that would typically be labeled
        on drawings or described on site during coordination, such as A, B,
        C, 1, 2, 3, etc. Defaults to "A".
    :type axis_tag: str, optional
    :param same_sense: Determines whether the direction of the axis's line
        is reversed. True means the direction the geometry is defined in
        represents the direction of the axis. False means the direction is
        reversed. Leave as True if unsure. Defaults to "True".
    :type same_sense: bool, optional
    :param uvw_axes: Choose from "UAxes", "VAxes" or "WAxes" depending on
        which set of axes the new axis you are adding should belong to.
        Defaults to "UAxes".
    :type uvw_axes: str, optional
    :param grid: The IfcGrid you are adding the axis to.
    :type grid: ifcopenshell.entity_instance
    :return: The newly created IfcGridAxis
    :rtype: ifcopenshell.entity_instance

    Example:

        # A pretty standard rectangular grid, with only two axes.
        grid = ifcopenshell.api.run("root.create_entity", model, ifc_class="IfcGrid")
        axis_a = ifcopenshell.api.run("grid.create_grid_axis", model,
            axis_tag="A", uvw_axes="UAxes", grid=grid)
        axis_1 = ifcopenshell.api.run("grid.create_grid_axis", model,
            axis_tag="1", uvw_axes="VAxes", grid=grid)
    """

    element = file.create_entity("IfcGridAxis", **{"AxisTag": axis_tag, "SameSense": same_sense})
    axes = list(getattr(grid, uvw_axes) or [])
    axes.append(element)
    setattr(grid, uvw_axes, axes)
    return element
