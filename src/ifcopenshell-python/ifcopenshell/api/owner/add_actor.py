    """Adds a new actor

    An actor is a person or an organisation who has a responsibility or role
    to play in a project. Actor roles include design consultants,
    architects, engineers, cost planners, suppliers, manufacturers,
    warrantors, owners, subcontractors, etc.

    Actors may either be project actors, who are responsible for the
    delivery of the project, or occupants, who are responsible for the
    consumption of the project.

    Identifying and managing actors is critical for asset management, and
    identifying liability for legal submissions.

    :param actor: Most commonly, an IfcOrganization (in compliance with GDPR
        requirements for non personally identifiable information), or an
        IfcPerson if it is a sole individual, or an IfcPersonAndOrganization
        if a specific person is liable within an organisation and must be
        legally nominated.
    :type actor: ifcopenshell.entity_instance
    :param ifc_class: Either "IfcActor" or "IfcOccupant".
    :type ifc_class: str, optional
    :return: The newly created IfcActor or IfcOccupant
    :rtype: ifcopenshell.entity_instance

    Example:

    .. code:: python

        # Setup an organisation with a single role
        organisation = ifcopenshell.api.owner.add_organisation(model,
            identification="AWB", name="Architects Without Ballpens")
        role = ifcopenshell.api.owner.add_role(model, assigned_object=organisation, role="ARCHITECT")

        # Assign that organisation to a newly created actor
        actor = ifcopenshell.api.owner.add_actor(model, actor=organisation)
    """
    settings = {"actor": actor, "ifc_class": ifc_class or "IfcActor"}

    actor = ifcopenshell.api.root.create_entity(file, ifc_class=settings["ifc_class"])
    actor.TheActor = settings["actor"]
