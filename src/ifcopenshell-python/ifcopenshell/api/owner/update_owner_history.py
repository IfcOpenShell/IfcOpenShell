    This ensures that the owner is tracked to have modified the object last,

        # [ ... example setup code ... ]

        # We've finished our ownership setup. Now let's start our script and

        # create_owner_history at all. This is already automatically handled
        # by the API when necessary. Under the hood, the API is actually
        # running this code on the IfcSpace element:
        # element.OwnerHistory = ifcopenshell.api.run("owner.create_owner_history", model)
