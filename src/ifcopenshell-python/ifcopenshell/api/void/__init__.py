"""Create void relationships between openings and physical elements

An opening is a special element (created using
:func:`ifcopenshell.api.root.create_entity`) that may then be used to create
voids in other elements (such as walls and slabs). These voids may then be
filled with doors, trapdoors, skylights, and so on.
