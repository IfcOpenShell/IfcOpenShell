    """Assigns a style directly to a representation item

    A style may either be assigned directly to an object's representation
    items, or to a material which is then associated with the object. If both
    exist, then the style assigned directly to the object's representation
    takes precedence. It is recommended to use materials and assign styles to
    materials. However, sometimes you may want to assign colours directly to
    the object representation as an override. This API function provides that
    capability.

    If you want to assign styles to a material instead (recommended), then
    please see ifcopenshell.api.style.assign_material_style.

    :param item: The IfcRepresentationItem of the object
        that you want to assign styles to.
    :param style: A presentation style, typically IfcSurfaceStyle. None if you
        want to remove an existing style from the item.
    :return: Created or existing IfcStyledItem, or None if the style was removed.

    Example:

    .. code:: python

        # A model context is needed to store 3D geometry
        model3d = ifcopenshell.api.context.add_context(model, context_type="Model")

        # Specifically, we want to store body geometry
        body = ifcopenshell.api.context.add_context(model,
            context_type="Model", context_identifier="Body", target_view="MODEL_VIEW", parent=model3d)

        # Let's create a new wall. The wall does not have any geometry yet.
        wall = ifcopenshell.api.root.create_entity(model, ifc_class="IfcWall")

        # Let's use the "3D Body" representation we created earlier to add a
        # new wall-like body geometry, 5 meters long, 3 meters high, and
        # 200mm thick
        representation = ifcopenshell.api.geometry.add_wall_representation(model,
            context=body, length=5, height=3, thickness=0.2)

        # Assign our new body geometry back to our wall

        # Place our wall at the origin
        ifcopenshell.api.geometry.edit_object_placement(model, product=wall)

        # Create a new surface style
        style = ifcopenshell.api.style.add_style(model)
