    :param styles: A list of presentation styles, typically IfcSurfaceStyle.
        The number of items in the list should correlate with the number of
        items in the shape_representation's Items attribute. If you have
        more items than styles, the last style is used.

    :param should_use_presentation_style_assignment: This is a technical
        detail to accomodate a bug in Revit. This should always be left as
        the default of False, unless you are finding that colours aren't
        showing up in Revit. In that case, set it to True, but keep in mind
        that this is no longer a valid IFC. Blame Autodesk.
