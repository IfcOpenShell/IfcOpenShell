    This does the inverse of assign_material_style.

    :param material: The IfcMaterial which you want to unassign the style from.
    :type material: ifcopenshell.entity_instance
    :param style: The IfcPresentationStyle (typically IfcSurfaceStyle) that
        you want to unassign from material. This will then be applied to all
        objects that have that material.
    :type style: ifcopenshell.entity_instance
    :param context: The IfcGeometricRepresentationSubContext at which this
        style should be unassigned. Typically this is the Model BODY context.
