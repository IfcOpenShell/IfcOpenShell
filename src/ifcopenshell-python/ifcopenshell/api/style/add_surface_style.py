    """Adds a new presentation item to a surface style

    A surface style can have multiple different types of presentation items
    assigned to it:

    - Shading, this is the simplest item, which defines a single basic
      colour and transparency that can be used to display the object on a
      screen. It is an indicative colour of what the object would be in real
      life. It is commonly incorrectly abused to colour code systems for MEP
      equipment or object types for structural steel. If you just want to
      give something a colour, this is what you need.
    - Rendering, this is an advanced extension of shading, which includes
      the definition of a shader for a rendering engine. You may select the
      reflectance / lighting model such as PHYSICAL, for PBR style
      rendering, or FLAT, for flat shading, or PHONG for older biased
      rendering workflows. Based on the chosen lighting model, you may then
      specify the appropriate colour maps, such as diffuse colours,
      specularity, emissive component, etc. These lighting models are fully
      compatible with glTF and X3D. This should be used if your model is
      prepared to be rendered by a rendering engine which is compatible with
      glTF / X3D shader descriptions. If you are doing archviz or 3D
      rendering, this is what you need.
    - Textures, this is a special type of Rendering presentation item that
      uses image textures instead of single colours. Textures may be either
      mapped using a bounding box stretch mapping, or with UV coordinates
      for mesh-like geometry.
    - Lighting, this is used to define photometrically accurate colour
      parameters used in lighting simulation. If you are a simulationist,
      this is what you need.
    - Reflectance, this is a special type of Lighting presentation item
      which includes some lesser used photometric properties, typically
      required for advanced materials like glazing.
    - External, this is for any other surface style defined using an
      external URI. This is relevant if you are using a third-party non-glTF
      compatible shader definition such as for Cycles, Renderman, V-Ray,
      etc, or a complex lighting simulation definition, such as for
      Radiance.

    Shading is sufficient for the majority of basic models.

    The attributes you specify will depend on the type of presentation item
    you are adding. An example is shown below, but for full details please
    refer to the IFC documentation.

    :param style: The IfcSurfaceStyle you want to add to presentation item
        to. See ifcopenshell.api.style.add_style.
    :type style: ifcopenshell.entity_instance
    :param ifc_class: Choose from IfcSurfaceStyleShading,
        IfcSurfaceStyleRendering, IfcSurfaceStyleWithTextures,
        IfcSurfaceStyleLighting, IfcSurfaceStyleReflectance, or
        IfcExternallyDefinedSurfaceStyle.
    :type ifc_class: str
    :param attributes: a dictionary of attribute names and values.
    :type attributes: dict, optional
    :return: The newly created presentation item based on the provided
        ifc_class.
    :rtype: ifcopenshell.entity_instance
