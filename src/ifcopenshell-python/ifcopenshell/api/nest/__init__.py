"""Nesting is when a component is attached to a host element

Examples include when a faucet is attached using a predrilled hole in a basin,
or when a modular connection occurs through a connection point. This implies
that when a host element moves, the child nested components must move as well.

Note that this API is not meant to be used for connection points on
distribution systems. For that purpose, such as for pipe fittings and
equipment, please see :mod:`ifcopenshell.api.system`.
