    Typically, work schedules would be assigned to a work plan at creation.
    However you may also delay this and do it manually afterwards.

        work plan.
    :type work_schedule: ifcopenshell.entity_instance
    :param work_plan: The IfcWorkPlan for the schedule to be assigned to.
    :type work_plan: ifcopenshell.entity_instance
    :return: The IfcRelAggregates relationship
    :rtype: ifcopenshell.entity_instance

    Example:

    .. code:: python

        # This will hold all our construction schedules
        work_plan = ifcopenshell.api.sequence.add_work_plan(model, name="Construction")

        # Alternatively, if you create a schedule without a work plan ...
        schedule = ifcopenshell.api.sequence.add_work_schedule(model, name="Construction Schedule A")

        # ... you can assign the work plan afterwards.
        ifcopenshell.api.sequence.assign_work_plan(work_schedule=schedule, work_plan=work_plan)
