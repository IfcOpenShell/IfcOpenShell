        """Assigns an object to be related to a process, typically a construction task

        Processes work using the ICOM (Input, Controls, Outputs, Mechanisms)
        paradigm in IFC. This process model is commonly used in modeling
        manufacturing functions.

        For example, processes (such as tasks) consume Inputs and transform them
        into Outputs. The process may only occur within the limits of Controls
        (e.g. cost items) and may require Mechanisms (ISO9000 calls them
        Mechanisms, whereas IFC calls them resources, such as raw materials,
        labour, or equipment).

                      +----------+
                      | Controls |
                      +----------+
                            |
                            V
        +--------+     +---------+     +---------+
        | Inputs | --> | Process | --> | Outputs |
        +--------+     +---------+     +---------+
                            ^
                            |
                      +-----------+
                      | Resources |
                      +-----------+

        There are three main scenarios where an object may be related to a
        task: defining inputs, controls, and resources of a process.

        For inputs, a product (i.e. wall) may be defined as an input to a task,
        such as when the task is to demolish the wall (i.e. the wall is an
        input, and there is no output).

        For controls, a cost item may be defined as a control to a task.

        For resources, any construction resource may be assigned to a task.

        :param relating_process: The IfcProcess (typically IfcTask) that the
            input, control, or resource is related to.
        :type relating_process: ifcopenshell.entity_instance.entity_instance
        :param related_object: The IfcProduct (for input), IfcCostItem (for
            control) or IfcConstructionResource (for resource).
        :type related_object: ifcopenshell.entity_instance.entity_instance
        :return: The newly created IfcRelAssignsToProcess relationship
        :rtype: ifcopenshell.entity_instance.entity_instance

        Example:

        .. code:: python

            # Let's imagine we are creating a construction schedule. All tasks
            # need to be part of a work schedule.
            schedule = ifcopenshell.api.run("sequence.add_work_schedule", model, name="Construction Schedule A")

            # Let's create a construction task. Note that the predefined type is
            # important to distinguish types of tasks.
            task = ifcopenshell.api.run("sequence.add_task", model,
                work_schedule=schedule, name="Demolish existing", identification="A", predefined_type="DEMOLITION")

            # Let's say we have a wall somewhere.
            wall = ifcopenshell.api.run("root.create_entity", model, ifc_class="IfcWall")
