    Note that a recurring task time must have a recurrence pattern, so if
    you remove it, be sure to clean up after this API call
    (e.g. remove IfcTaskTimeRecurring entity
    or assign a different recurrence patern to it
    or replace IfcTaskTimeRecurring with IfcTaskTime).

    Example:

    .. code:: python

        # Let's create a new calendar.
        calendar = ifcopenshell.api.sequence.add_work_calendar(model)

        # Let's start defining the times that we work during the week.
