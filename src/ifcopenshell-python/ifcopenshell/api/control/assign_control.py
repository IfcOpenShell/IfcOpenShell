    """Assigns a planning control or constraint to an object

    IFC can describe concepts that control other objects. For example, a
    planning calendar controls the availability of working days for
    construction planning. As another example, a cost item might constrain
    or limit the ability to procure and build a product.

    This usecase lets you assign controls following the rules of the IFC
    specification. This is an advanced topic and assumes knowledge of the
    IFC concepts to determine what is allowed to control what. In the
    future, this API will likely be deprecated in favour of multiple usecase
    specific APIs.

    :param relating_control: The IfcControl entity that is creating the
        control or constraint
    :type relating_control: ifcopenshell.entity_instance
    :param related_object: The IfcObjectDefinition that is being controlled
    :type related_object: ifcopenshell.entity_instance
    :return: The newly created IfcRelAssignsToControl. If relationship already
        existed before and wasn't changed then returns None.
    :rtype: ifcopenshell.entity_instance, None

    Example:

        # One common usecase is to assign a calendar to a task
        calendar = ifcopenshell.api.sequence.add_work_calendar(model)

        task = ifcopenshell.api.sequence.add_task(model,
            work_schedule=schedule)

        # All subtasks will inherit this calendar, so assigning a single
        # calendar to the root task effectively defines a "default" calendar
        ifcopenshell.api.control.assign_control(model,
            relating_control=calendar, related_object=task)

        # Another common example might be relating a cost item and a product
