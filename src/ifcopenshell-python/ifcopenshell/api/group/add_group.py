    """Adds a new group

    An IFC group is an arbitrary collection of products, which are typically
    physical. It may be used when there is no other more specific group
    which may be used. Other types of groups include distribution systems,
    which group together products that are connected and circulate a medium
    (such as fluid or electricity), or zones, which group together spaces,
    or structural load groups, which group together loads for structural
    analysis, or inventories, which are groups of assets.

    :param Name: The name of the group. Defaults to "Unnamed"
    :type Name: str, optional
    :param description: The description of the purpose of the group.
    :type description: str, optional
    :return: The newly created IfcGroup
    :rtype: ifcopenshell.entity_instance

    Example:

    .. code:: python

        ifcopenshell.api.run("group.add_group", model, name="Unit 1A")
    """
    settings = {
        "name": name or "Unnamed",
