    """Unassigns products from their aggregate

    A product (i.e. a smaller part of a whole) may be aggregated into zero
    or one larger space or element. This function will remove that
    aggregation relationship.

    As all physical IFC model elements must be part of a hierarchical tree
    called the "spatial decomposition", using this function will remove the
    product from that tree. This is a dangerous operation and may result in
    the product no longer being visible in IFC applications.

    If the product is not part of an aggregation relationship, nothing will
    happen.

    :param products: The list of parts of the aggregate, typically of IfcElements or
        IfcSpatialStructureElement subclass
    :type product: list[ifcopenshell.entity_instance]
    :return: None
    :rtype: None

    Example:

    .. code:: python

        element = ifcopenshell.api.run("root.create_entity", model, ifc_class="IfcSite")
        subelement1 = ifcopenshell.api.run("root.create_entity", model, ifc_class="IfcBuilding")
        subelement2 = ifcopenshell.api.run("root.create_entity", model, ifc_class="IfcBuilding")
        ifcopenshell.api.run("aggregate.assign_object", model, products=[subelement1], relating_object=element)
        ifcopenshell.api.run("aggregate.assign_object", model, products=[subelement2], relating_object=element)
        # nothing is returned
        ifcopenshell.api.run("aggregate.unassign_object", model, products=[subelement1])
        # nothing is returned, relationship is removed
        ifcopenshell.api.run("aggregate.unassign_object", model, products=[subelement2])
