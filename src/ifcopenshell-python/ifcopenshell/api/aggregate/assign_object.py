    """Assigns object as an aggregate to the products

    All physical IFC model elements must be part of a hierarchical tree
    called the "spatial decomposition", where large things are made up of
    smaller things. This tree always begins at an "IfcProject" and is then
    broken down using "decomposition" relationships, of which aggregation is
    the first relationship you will use.

    Typically used when you want to describe how large spaces are made up of
    smaller spaces. For example large spatial elements (e.g. sites,
    buidings) can be made out of smaller spatial elements (e.g. storeys,
    spaces).

    The largest space (typically the IfcSite) can then be aggregated in a
    project. It is requirement for all spatial structures to be directly or
    indirectly aggregated back to the IfcProject to create a hierarchy of
    spaces.

    The other common usecase is when larger physical products are made up of
    smaller physical products. For example, a stair might be made out of a
    flight, a landing, a railing and so on. Or a wall might be made out of
    stud members, and coverings.

    As a product may only have a single location in the "spatial
    decomposition" tree, assigning an aggregate relationship will remove any
    previous aggregation, containment, or nesting relationships it may have.

    IFC placements follow a convention where the placement is relative to
    its parent in the spatial hierarchy. If your product has a placement,
    its placement will be recalculated to follow this convention.

    :param products: The list of parts of the aggregate, typically of IfcElement or
        IfcSpatialStructureElement subclass
    :type product: list[ifcopenshell.entity_instance]
    :param relating_object: The whole of the aggregate, typically an
        IfcElement or IfcSpatialStructureElement subclass
    :type relating_object: ifcopenshell.entity_instance
    :return: The IfcRelAggregate relationship instance
        or `None` if `products` was empty list.
