    Setting the correct georeferencing parameters is a complex topic and
    should ideally be done with three parties present: the lead architect,
    surveyor, and a third-party digital engineer with expertise in IFC to
    moderate. For more information, read the BlenderBIM Add-on documentation
    for Georeferencing:
    https://docs.bonsaibim.org/users/advanced/georeferencing.html

    For more information about the attributes and data types of an
    IfcCoordinateOperation, consult the IFC documentation.

    For more information about the attributes and data types of an
    IfcProjectedCRS, consult the IFC documentation.

    See ifcopenshell.util.geolocation for more utilities to convert to and
    from local and map coordinates to check your results.
