    """Edits the true north

    Given project north being up (i.e. a vector of 0, 1), true north is defined
    as a unitised 2D vector pointing to true north. Alternatively, true north
    may be defined as a rotation from project north to true north.
    Anticlockwise is positive.

    Note that true north is not part of georeferencing, and is only optionally
    provided as a reference value, typically for solar analysis. Remember: grid
    north (what your surveyor will typically use) is not the same as true
    north!

    :param true_north: A unitised 2D vector, where each ordinate is a float, or
        an angle in decimal degrees where anticlockwise is positive.

    Example:

    .. code:: python

        # Both of these are identical, and indicate that:
        # - If project north is up the page, true north is in the top left
        # - The building is therefore facing north east
        ifcopenshell.api.georeference.edit_true_north(model, true_north=30)
        ifcopenshell.api.georeference.edit_true_north(model, true_north=(-0.5, 0.8660254))
