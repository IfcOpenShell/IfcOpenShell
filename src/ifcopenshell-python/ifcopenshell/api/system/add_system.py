    """Add a new distribution system

    A distribution system is a group of distribution elements, like ducts,
    pipes, pumps, filters, fans, and so on that distribute a medium (air,
    liquid, or electricity) throughout a facility. Systems may be
    hierarchical, with larger systems composed of smaller subsystems.

    :param ifc_class: The type of system, chosen from IfcDistributionSystem
        for mechanical, electrical, communications, plumbing, fire, or
        security systems. Alternatively you may choose IfcBuildingSystem for
        specialised building facade systems or similar. For IFC2X3, choose
        IfcSystem.
    :type ifc_class: str
    :return: The newly created IfcSystem.
    :rtype: ifcopenshell.entity_instance

    Example:

    .. code:: python

        # A completely empty distribution system
        system = ifcopenshell.api.run("system.add_system", model)
    """
    settings = {"ifc_class": ifc_class}
