        """Connects two ports together

        A distribution element (e.g. a duct) may be connected to another
        distribution element (e.g. a fitting) by connecting a port at one of the
        duct to a port at the same end of the fitting.

        Ports may only have one connection, so you cannot have multiple things
        connected to the same port. Nor can you have incompatible port
        connections, such as an electrical port connected to an airflow port.

        Port connectivity may be explicit or implicit. Explicit connections are
        where the port connectivity is described for every single distribution
        element in detail. For example, a duct segment would have port
        connections to a duct fitting, which would have port connections to
        another duct segment, all the way from a fan to an air terminal exactly
        as constructed on site. Implicit connections only consider the key
        distribution control elements (e.g. the fan and the terminal) and ignore
        all of the details of the duct segments and fittings in between.
        Generally, explicit connectivity is preferred for later detailed design,
        and implicit connectivity is preferred for early phase design.

        :param port1: The port of the first distribution element to connect.
        :type port1: ifcopenshell.entity_instance.entity_instance
        :param port2: The port of the second distribution element to connect.
        :type port2: ifcopenshell.entity_instance.entity_instance
        :param direction: The directionality of distribution flow through the
            port connection. NOTDEFINED means that the direction has not yet
            been determined. This is useful during preliminary system design.
            SOURCE means that the flow is from the first element to the second
            element. SINK means that the flow is from the second element to the
            first element. SOURCEANDSINK means that flow is bi-directional
            between the first and second element.  SOURCEANDSINK is a relatively
            rare scenario.
        :type direction: str
        :param element: Optionally set an element through which the port
            connectivity is made, such as a segment or fitting. This is only to
            be used for implicit port connectivity where the segments and
            fittings are less important.
        :type element: ifcopenshell.entity_instance.entity_instance

            # The duct and fitting is part of the system
