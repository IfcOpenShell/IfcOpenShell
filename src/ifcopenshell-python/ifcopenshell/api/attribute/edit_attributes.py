    """Edit the attributes of a product

    All IFC entities have attributes. Normally they can be edited directly,
    by simply assigning a new value to them. In some scenarios, you may wish
    to also ensure that ownership history is updated. This function provides
    that convenience.

    The method will maintain consistency for PredefinedType attribute
    based on whether ElementType/ObjectType and whether occurrence is typed:

    - PredefinedType and ObjectType to be `None` if occurrence is typed
    - PredefinedType to be "NOTDEFINED" if ElementType/ObjectType is None
    - PredefinedType to be "USERDEFINED" if ElementType/ObjectType is not None

    :param product: The product you want to edit. This may be any rooted IFC
        entity.
    :type product: ifcopenshell.entity_instance
    :param attributes: a dictionary of attribute names and values.
    :type attributes: dict
    :return: None
    :rtype: None

    Example:

    .. code:: python

        element = ifcopenshell.api.root.create_entity(model, ifc_class="IfcWall")
        ifcopenshell.api.attribute.edit_attributes(model,
            product=element, attributes={"Name": "Waldo"})

        """Return attribute value or Ellipsis if attribute doesn't exist.

        Useful as an alternative to hasattr - hasattr under the hood just does
        getattr but doesn't return a value. That helps reduce times IFC is accessed.
