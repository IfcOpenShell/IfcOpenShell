    """Remove a constraint (typically an objective)

    Removes a constraint definition and all of its associations to any
    products. Typically this would be an IfcObjective, although technically
    you can associate IfcMetrics ith products too, though the meaning may be
    unclear.

    :param constraint: The IfcObjective you want to remove.
    :type constraint: ifcopenshell.entity_instance
    :return: None
    :rtype: None

    Example:

    .. code:: python

        objective = ifcopenshell.api.constraint.add_objective(model)
        ifcopenshell.api.constraint.remove_constraint(model,
            constraint=objective)
    """
    settings = {"constraint": constraint}

    file.remove(settings["constraint"])
