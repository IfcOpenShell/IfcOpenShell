IfcOpenShell
============

IfcOpenShell is an open source (LGPL-3.0-or-later) C++ software library for
working with the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) file format.

Extensive geometric support is implemented for the IFC releases IFC2x3 TC1 and
IFC4 Add2 TC1. Support for parsing is provided for IFC4x1, IFC4x2, and the
IFC4x3 release candidates.  Extending with support for arbitrary IFC schemas is
possible at compile-time when using C++ and at run-time when using Python.

   It is not necessary to be a C++ developer to use IfcOpenShell. Please see
   other sections such as :doc:`ifcopenshell-python`, :doc:`ifcconvert`, and
   more.
