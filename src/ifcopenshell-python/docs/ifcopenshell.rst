IfcOpenShell
============

IfcOpenShell is an open source (LGPL-3.0-or-later) software library for working
with the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) file format. Extensive geometric
support is implemented for the IFC releases IFC2x3 TC1 and IFC4 Add2 TC1.
Support for parsing is provided for IFC4x1, IFC4x2, and the IFC4x3 release
candidates.  Extending with support for arbitrary IFC schemas is possible at
compile-time when using C++ and at run-time when using Python.
