Installation
============

If you'd like to work with the C++ core of IfcOpenShell, these guides will show
you how to compile and install IfcOpenShell.

.. note::

    It is not necessary to compile IfcOpenShell if you only want to use
    IfcOpenShell-Python, IfcConvert, or the other utilities such as IfcClash or
    IfcDiff. Compilation is only necessary for C++ developers.

You will need:

- `Git <https://git-scm.com/>`__
- `CMake <https://cmake.org/>`__ (3.1.3 or newer)

IfcOpenShell depends on:

- `Boost <http://www.boost.org/>`__
- `OpenCascade <https://dev.opencascade.org/>`__ - for building IfcGeom For
  converting IFC representation items into BRep solids and tessellated meshes
- (Optional) `OpenCOLLADA <https://github.com/khronosGroup/OpenCOLLADA/>`__ -
  for IfcConvert to be able to write tessellated Collada (.dae) files
- (Optional) `SWIG <http://www.swig.org/>`__ and `Python
  <https://www.python.org/>`__ - for building the IfcOpenShell Python interface
  and use in the BlenderBIM Add-on
- (Optional) `HDF5 <https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hdf5>`__ - for caching
  geometry using the HDF5 format

Compiling on Linux
------------------

The following instructions are for Ubuntu, modify as required for other
operating systems. GCC (4.7 or newer) or Clang (any version) is required.

.. seealso::

    The `nix/build-all.py <https://github.com/IfcOpenShell/IfcOpenShell/tree/master/nix/build-all.py>`__
    script can be experimented with and studied for pointers for other operating
    systems. Note that this script is not currently meant to be used for a
    typical IfcOpenShell workspace setup.

1. Fetch the latest source code, including all submodules.

   ::

        $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/IfcOpenShell/IfcOpenshell.git

   .. warning::

        The path where the source code is cloned to can contain spaces but non-ASCII
        characters are very likely to cause problems with the build.

2. Install basic dependencies:

   ::

       $ sudo apt-get install git cmake gcc g++ libboost-all-dev libcgal-dev

3. Install OpenCascade Technology (OCCT).

   ::

        $ sudo apt-get install libocct-data-exchange-dev libocct-draw-dev libocct-foundation-dev libocct-modeling-algorithms-dev libocct-modeling-data-dev libocct-ocaf-dev libocct-visualization-dev

   .. seealso::

        If OCCT is not available, an alternative is to `manually compile OCCT
        <https://dev.opencascade.org/release>`__.

   Another alternative is to use OpenCascade Community Edition (OCE), but it may
   lag behind OCCT and is no longer actively maintained so is not recommended.

   ::

        $ sudo apt-get install liboce-foundation-dev liboce-modeling-dev liboce-ocaf-dev liboce-visualization-dev liboce-ocaf-lite-dev

   As a final alternative, you may also manually compile OCE:

   ::

        $ sudo apt-get install libftgl-dev libtbb2 libtbb-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libfreetype6-dev
        $ git clone https://github.com/tpaviot/oce.git
        $ cd oce
        $ mkdir build && cd build
        $ cmake ..
        # Replace X with number of CPU cores + 1
        $ make -j X
        $ sudo make install

   .. warning::

    Choose one option only between installing OCCT, installing OCE, or
    self-compilation. If you install and compile multiple versions of
    OpenCascade, your system may get confused.


4. For building IfcConvert with COLLADA (.dae) support (ON by default), OpenCOLLADA is needed:

   ::

        $ sudo apt-get install libpcre3-dev libxml2-dev
        $ git clone https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenCOLLADA.git
        $ cd OpenCOLLADA
        # Using a known good revision, but HEAD should work too:
        $ git checkout 064a60b65c2c31b94f013820856bc84fb1937cc6
        $ mkdir build && cd build
        $ cmake ..
        # Replace X with number of CPU cores + 1
        $ make -j X
        $ sudo make install

5. For building the IfcPython wrapper (ON by default), SWIG and Python development are needed:

   ::

        $ sudo apt-get install python-all-dev swig

6. For building support for HDF5 caching (ON by default), install dependencies:

   ::

        $ sudo apt-get install libhdf5-dev libaec-dev zlibc

7. Compile IfcOpenShell itself.

   ::

        $ cd /path/to/IfcOpenShell
        $ mkdir build && cd build
        # Customise the compile options to suit your environment
        # Check all paths are valid for your environment
        $ cmake ../cmake \
              -DOCC_LIBRARY_DIR=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ \
              -DOCC_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include/ \

              # Optional Collada support
              -DCOLLADA_SUPPORT=On
              -DOPENCOLLADA_INCLUDE_DIR="/usr/local/include/opencollada" \
              -DOPENCOLLADA_LIBRARY_DIR="/usr/local/lib/opencollada"  \
              -DPCRE_LIBRARY_DIR=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ \

              # Optional HDF5 support
              -DHDF5_SUPPORT=On
              -DHDF5_LIBRARIES="/usr/local/hdf5/lib/libhdf5_cpp.so;/usr/local/hdf5/lib/libhdf5.so;/usr/lib64/libz.so;/usr/lib64/libsz.so;/usr/lib64/libaec.so" \
              -DHDF5_INCLUDE_DIR="/usr/local/hdf5/include" \

              -DCGAL_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include \
              -DGMP_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include \
              -DMPFR_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include \
              -DGMP_LIBRARY_DIR=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu \
              -DMPFR_LIBRARY_DIR=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu
        # Replace X with number of CPU cores + 1
        $ make -j X
        # Optionally install to the system
        $ sudo make install


Compiling on MacOS
------------------

GCC (4.7 or newer) or Clang (any version) is required.

1. Fetch the latest source code, including all submodules.

   ::

        $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/IfcOpenShell/IfcOpenshell.git

   .. warning::

        The path where the source code is cloned to can contain spaces but non-ASCII
        characters are very likely to cause problems with the build.

2. Install all dependencies using `Homebrew <https://brew.sh/>`__

   ::

        $ brew install boost cmake python3 cgal ftgl gmp libaec opencascade swig hdf5 zlib
        # homebrew automatically links most libraries, except some keg-only ones
        $ brew link zlib --force

3. Build IfcOpenShell with flags for Homebrew dependencies: (``/usr/local/``) for Intel machines with x84_64 architecture,
(``/opt/homebrew/``) for Apple Silicon processors with arm64 architecture.

   ::

        $ cd /path/to/IfcOpenShell
        $ mkdir build && cd build
        $ cmake ../cmake
            -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/opt/homebrew/bin/python3.10 \
            -DPYTHON_LIBRARY=/opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.10/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.10/lib/libpython3.10.dylib \
            -DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=/opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.10/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.10/include/python3.10/ \
            -DOCC_LIBRARY_DIR=/opt/homebrew/lib/ \
            -DOCC_INCLUDE_DIR=/opt/homebrew/include/opencascade/ \
            -DCGAL_INCLUDE_DIR=/opt/homebrew/include/ \
            -DGMP_LIBRARY_DIR=/opt/homebrew/lib/ \
            -DMPFR_LIBRARY_DIR=/opt/homebrew/lib/
            -DHDF5_LIBRARY_DIR=/opt/homebrew/lib/ \
            -DHDF5_INCLUDE_DIR=/opt/homebrew/include/ \
            -DCOLLADA_SUPPORT=0 \
        # Replace X with number of CPU cores, which you can get with sysctl -n hw.ncpu
        $ make -j X

Compiling on Windows (Visual Studio)
------------------------------------

This is for users of  `Visual Studio <https://www.visualstudio.com/>`__ 2008 to
2019 (2022 not yet supported by dependency CMake) with C++ toolset (or `Visual
C++ Build Tools <http://landinghub.visualstudio.com/visual-cpp-build-tools>`__).

1. Fetch the latest source code, including all submodules.

   ::

        $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/IfcOpenShell/IfcOpenshell.git

   .. warning::

        The path where the source code is cloned to can contain spaces but non-ASCII
        characters are very likely to cause problems with the build.

2. Assuming Visual Studio 2015 x64 environment variables set, build dependencies
   and run cmake.

   ::

        $ cd IfcOpenShell\win
        $ build-deps.cmd
        $ run-cmake.bat

3. Open and build the solution file in Visual Studio:

   ::

        $ ..\build-vs2015-x64\IfcOpenShell.sln

   As the scripts default to using the ``RelWithDebInfo`` configuration, and a
   freshly created solution by CMake defaults to ``Debug``, make sure to switch the
   used build configuration. Build the ``INSTALL`` project (right-click -> Project
   Only) to deploy the headers and binaries into a single location if
   wanted/needed.

   Alternatively, one can use the utility batch file(s) to build and install the
   project easily from the command-line (installing a project will build it
   also, if required):

   ::

        $ install-ifcopenshell.bat

.. seealso::

    For more information on configuring a Windows compilation see the `Windows
    Readme
    <https://github.com/IfcOpenShell/IfcOpenShell/blob/v0.7.0/win/readme.md>`__.

Compiling on Windows (MSYS2 + MinGW)
------------------------------------

This is for users of `MSYS2 <https://msys2.github.io/>`__ and `MinGW
<https://www.mingw-w64.org/>`__.

1. Fetch the latest source code, including all submodules.

   ::

        $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/IfcOpenShell/IfcOpenshell.git

   .. warning::

        The path where the source code is cloned to can contain spaces but non-ASCII
        characters are very likely to cause problems with the build.

2. Start the MSYS2 Shell and then:

   ::

        $ cd IfcOpenShell/win
        $ ./build-deps.sh
        $ ./run-cmake.sh
        $ ./install-ifcopenshell.sh

.. seealso::

    For more information on configuring a Windows compilation see the `Windows
    Readme
    <https://github.com/IfcOpenShell/IfcOpenShell/blob/v0.7.0/win/readme.md>`__.
