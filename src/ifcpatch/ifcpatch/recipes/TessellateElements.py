        """Convert element body representations to tessellations or faceted breps

        Some software have bugs that result in incorrect geometry being
        imported for more complex representation types, such as CSGs. This
        patch converts elements matching your query into a tessellation (or
        faceted brep for IFC2X3) which is generally supported by all
        implementations. Note that styles and shape aspects are not preserved.

        See example bug: https://github.com/Autodesk/revit-ifc/issues/707

        Example:

        .. code:: python

            ifcpatch.execute({"input": "input.ifc", "file": model, "recipe": "TessellateElements", "arguments": ["IfcBeam"]})
        """
