        """Regenerate GlobalIds in an IFC model

        All root elements in an IFC model must be identified by a unique Global
        ID (also known as a GUID or UUID). Some proprietary BIM software do this
        incorrect (I know right), either by generating an invalid ID, creating
        duplicate IDs, generating IDs in a way that is not universally unique or
        as random as you might prefer (e.g. non-compliant with UUID v4).

        This will regenerate new GlobalIds for the entire model.

        :param only_duplicates: If set to True, new GlobalIds will only be
            generated for duplicate IDs. This is a safe thing to run to ensure
            IFCs are valid. If False, all GlobalIds will be regenerated.
        :type only_duplicates: bool

        Example:

        .. code:: python

            # Regenerate all GlobalIds
            ifcpatch.execute({"input": model, "recipe": "RegenerateGlobalIds", "arguments": []})

            # Regenerate only duplicate GlobalIds
            ifcpatch.execute({"input": model, "recipe": "RegenerateGlobalIds", "arguments": [True]})
        """
        self.src = src

        self.logger = logger
        self.only_duplicates = only_duplicates

    def patch(self):
        if self.only_duplicates:
            guids = set()
            for element in self.file.by_type("IfcRoot"):
                if element.GlobalId in guids:
                    element.GlobalId = ifcopenshell.guid.new()
                elif len(element.GlobalId) != 22 or element.GlobalId[0] not in "0123":
                    element.GlobalId = ifcopenshell.guid.new()
                else:
                    try:
