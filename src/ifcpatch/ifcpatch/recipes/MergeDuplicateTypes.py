        """Merge duplicate element types via the Tag or another attribute

        Revit is notorious for creating many duplicate element types. Element
        types may be duplicated by being mirrored, such as doors, columns, etc,
        or being certain MEP equipment. This means that even though you think
        you might have only 3 door families and 3 door types in your door
        schedule, your IFC might actually incorrectly store 6 or more door types.

        Revit stores the Revit Element ID in the "Tag" attribute of all IFC
        elements, so we can deduce that multiple IFC elements with the same Tag
        attribute have been duplicated in IFC. This patch will merge them into a
        single element type.

        You may optionally specify your own attribute if you want to merge using
        different criteria, such as "Name". For example, may Revit users
        incorrectly have multiple types with the same name as workarounds to
        overcome various Revit limitations. This is incorrect and this patch
        will merge the types into a single type.

        Occurrences of the type will be remapped to the merged type.

        :param attribute: The name of the attribute to merge element types based
            on. Typically this will be "Tag" as it stores the unique ID from the
            proprietary BIM software.
        :type attribute: str

        Example:

        .. code:: python

            # Default behaviour of merging by Tag attribute
            ifcpatch.execute({"file": model, "recipe": "MergeDuplicateTypes", "arguments": []})

            # Explicitly say we want to merge based on the Name attribute
            ifcpatch.execute({"file": model, "recipe": "MergeDuplicateTypes", "arguments": ["Name"]})
