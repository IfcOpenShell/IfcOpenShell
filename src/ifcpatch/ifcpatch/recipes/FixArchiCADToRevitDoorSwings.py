        # ArchiCAD has the ability to store 2D data with objects like doors for
        # door swings. ArchiCAD's implementation is not 100% correct (using
        # footprint instead of annotation contexts), but otherwise not too
        # shabby.
        #
        # Revit, however, is incapable of understanding this 2D representation.
        # Revit users linking in IFCs produced by ArchiCAD may experience the
        # following symptoms:
        #
        # A. Invisible doors, and difficulty selecting doors
        # B. Invisible door swings, or only visible at particular view ranges
        # C. Weird arc shapes around doors
        # D. Extra lines around doors and walls
        # E. Cannot easily change visibility graphics of 2D vs 3D elements
        # F. Cannot view 2D data in a 3D view
        #
        # This is caused by the perfect storm of Revit IFC bugs, which we will
        # work through methodically.

        # Revit has the ability to switch between 3D representations and 2D
        # representations (e.g. in plan view). It does this by detecting IFC
        # representations that belong to either the Model Body representation
        # for 3D and the "Annotation" representation for 2D. Note: this is not a real
        # "Annotation" representation. It is an invalid representation that is
        # hardcoded in Revit. Nevertheless, if you follow their incorrect
        # context naming convention by renaming ArchiCAD's also incorrect
        # FootPrint context (but less incorrect) to Annotation, Revit will show
        # 2D door representations as desired and switch between 2D and 3D
        # intelligently.
        #
        # See bug https://github.com/Autodesk/revit-ifc/issues/187

        # However, we will not use this approach (hence it is commented out).
        # This is because Revit will generate a single object with both a
        # magically switching 2D and 3D representation - you cannot control both
        # representations independently. Furthermore, the 2D representation is
        # always generated at a Z value of 0. This means that the door swings
        # are always invisible on any view range apart from those typically near
        # an elevation of 0 which won't work for most projects. Because they are
        # merged into a single object, you cannot fix the 2D elevation without
        # breaking your 3D elevation. Even if we split it into 2D and 3D
        # objects, the 2D object can only be moved up in 3D or section, but
        # Revit makes the object invisible in 3D or section, so go fish.
        #
        # See symptom B.

        # Purge axis representations from walls. Revit will draw the axis (a
        # line through the wall) but doesn't give you control over its
        # visibility, resulting in very ugly walls and lines typically cutting
        # across door openings.

        # objects. Before we do that, we're going to cull the 2D representation
        # from door types. If we didn't, this scenario may occur:
        #
        # 1. 3D IfcDoors with IfcDoorType import as Revit doors
        # 2. 2D IfcBuildingElementProxy with no type import as Revit generic model
        # 3. The Revit user turns off the visibility of the door category.
        # 4. The user is shocked to see that generic models are now invisible,
        #    even though it is clearly a separate category to doors.
        #
        # This should be a warning to all Revit users that unintuitively
        # visibility graphics actually do _not_ affect the categories (e.g.
        # Door, Window) for instances. Instead, they target categories for
        # representation maps types, even if an instance is untyped. Yikes!
