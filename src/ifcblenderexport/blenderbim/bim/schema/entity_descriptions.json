    "IfcWindowStyle": "The window style defines a particular style of windows, which may be included into the spatial context of the building model through instances of IfcWindow. A window style defines the overall parameter of the window style and refers to the particular parameter of the lining and one (or several) panels through IfcWindowLiningProperties and IfcWindowPanelProperties.",
    "IfcWindowType": "The element type IfcWindowType defines commonly shared information for occurrences of windows. The set of shared information may include:",
    "IfcWorkCalendar": "An IfcWorkCalendar defines working and non-working time periods for tasks and resources. It enables to define both specific time periods, such as from 7:00 till 12:00 on 25th August 2009, as well as repetitive time periods based on frequently used recurrence patterns, such as each Monday from 7:00 till 12:00 between 1st March 2009 and 31st December 2009.",
    "IfcWorkControl": "An IfcWorkControl is an abstract supertype which captures information that is common to both IfcWorkPlan and IfcWorkSchedule.",
    "IfcWorkPlan": "An IfcWorkPlan represents work plans in a construction or a facilities management project.",
    "IfcWorkSchedule": "An IfcWorkSchedule represents a task schedule of a work plan, which in turn can contain a set of schedules for different purposes.",
    "IfcWorkTime": "IfcWorkTime defines time periods that are used by IfcWorkCalendar for either describing working times or non-working exception times. Besides start and finish dates, a set of time periods can be given by various types of recurrence patterns.",
    "IfcZone": "A zone is\u00a0a group of spaces, partial spaces or other zones. Zone structures may not be hierarchical (in contrary to the spatial structure of a project - see IfcSpatialStructureElement), i.e. one individual IfcSpace may be associated with zero, one, or several IfcZone's. IfcSpace's are grouped into an IfcZone by using the objectified relationship IfcRelAssignsToGroup as specified at the supertype IfcGroup.",
    "IfcZShapeProfileDef": "IfcZShapeProfileDef defines a section profile that provides the defining parameters of a Z-shape section to be used by the swept area solid. Its parameters and orientation relative to the position coordinate system are according to the following illustration. The centre of the position coordinate system is in the profile's centre of the bounding box."
