So, here are some note needed to know about how quantities are calculated.

NET VOLUME AND GROSS VOLUME
The difference between gross volume and net volume is that the gross volume is calculated
without the related IFC opening.
So, if an object is created lets say with a hole but without defining the opening, the hole is counted into net volume (so get volume and net volume are the same).
This is in order to follow the native IFC approach.

WALLS 
Walls quantities are calculated with the convention that the object main axis is the 'x'. 
Also openings inside a wall have to main axis 'x'

SLAB THICKNESS
The slab thickness is defined as Width, following the IFC definition
Also, note that these dimensions are calculated only if the slab is prismatic.

LATERAL AREA
All lateral areas are counted, so for example also the inside surfaces.
It shouldn't be like that so we should find a method to only external lateral area.

DOORS AND WINDOWS
Doors and Windows have to have the main axis along 'x' and the height is measured along 'z' axis

SPACES
For calculating FinishFloorHeight and FinishCeilingHeight it substract the related IfcCovering with predefined type 'CEILING' and 'FLOORING'.
NetPerimeter needs to substract related doors so basically it's needed to get the bounding walls. At this moment, i don't know how to do that.
I created btw a "get_space_net_perimeter" that does nothing, only for reminder.
Also GrossWallArea and NetWallArea need bounding object so for the moment is still in the todo list.
GrossFloorArea: following the definition, it should exclude the wall claddings, but for now, this is not considered into the calculation.
NetFloorArea: it doesn't count the following entities contained in the spatial entity: IfcColumn and IfcWall. Just add other entities into 'get_net_floor_area' if it's needed
NetVolume: like NetFloorArea, it doesn't count the following entities contained in the spatial entity: IfcColumn and IfcWall
Also, the entire IfcColumn (or IfcWall) object volume is substracted, so it should be better to substract only the shared volume between IfcSpace and IfcColumn. Look at todo list



REMAINING TODO FUNCTIONS
IfcSpace - NetPerimeter
IfcSpace - GrossWallArea
IfcSpace - NetWallArea
IfcSpace - Calculate only shared volume between IfcColumn and IfcSpace
IfcPipeSegment - Gross cross section area
Qto_PipeFittingBaseQuantities - Basically all quantities because the object can not be straight
