# Hey there! Welcome to the BlenderBIM Add-on code. Please feel free to reach
# out if you have any questions or need further guidance. Happy hacking!

# ############################################################################ #

# Every module has a prop.py file to define Blender properties. Any time you
# want an interface widget like an input field, dropdown, checkbox, or number
# slider, you need a Blender property to store that widget's data. If you want
# to store data that will affect the Blender interface, you also need a
# property. Properties are stored in the .blend file, so when your user closes
# their Blender session, and reopens it, things are how they left it.

import bpy
from bpy.types import PropertyGroup

# Properties have many different data types. We won't use all of them in this
# demo module, but this is a list for your reference.
from bpy.props import (
    PointerProperty,
    StringProperty,
    EnumProperty,
    BoolProperty,
    IntProperty,
    FloatProperty,
    FloatVectorProperty,
    CollectionProperty,
)


# All properties must belong in a property group. Usually, you'd have a group
# named after your module.
class BIMDemoProperties(PropertyGroup):
    # This first property is a string. This means that in the interface, it will
    # represent a text input field. We can give it a name and a default value.
    # The name will be the label shown next to the input field in the interface.
    name: StringProperty(name="Name", default="New Project Name")
    # Not all properties need to be shown using their equivalent input widget.
    # In this case, we can store a message string, but we will never show it as
    # an input text field in the ui.py.
    message: StringProperty(name="Message")
    show_hints: BoolProperty(name="Show Hints", default=False)
