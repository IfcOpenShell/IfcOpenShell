# Hey there! Welcome to the BlenderBIM Add-on code. Please feel free to reach
# out if you have any questions or need further guidance. Happy hacking!

# ############################################################################ #

# Every module has a __init__.py file to load all of its classes. Every
# operation, property, and interface needs to be registered with the Blender
# system when the add-on loads. This is where it happens.

import bpy
from . import ui, prop, operator

# You'll need to provide a list of every one of your classes here. If you forget
# to specify your class, it won't load and you won't be able to use that
# operator, property, or interface.
classes = (
    operator.DemonstrateHelloWorld,
    operator.DemonstrateRenameProject,
    prop.BIMDemoProperties,
    ui.BIM_PT_demo,
)


# When the add-on loads, this register function is called. This allows you to
# perform additional tasks during startup. If you need to store custom
# properties, this is where you tell Blender where they are going to be stored.
# You might see more advanced registrations happening in other modules.
def register():
    # Properties are usually stored on bpy.types.Scene when they are something
    # that affects everything in the project, or bpy.types.Object when they
    # affect a single BIM element.
    bpy.types.Scene.BIMDemoProperties = bpy.props.PointerProperty(type=prop.BIMDemoProperties)


# When someone disables the add-on, we need to unload everything we loaded. This
# does the reverse of the register function.
def unregister():
    del bpy.types.Scene.BIMDemoProperties
