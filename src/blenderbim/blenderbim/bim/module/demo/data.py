# Hey there! Welcome to the BlenderBIM Add-on code. Please feel free to reach
# out if you have any questions or need further guidance. Happy hacking!

# Every module has a data.py file to load data for its interface panels to
# display. When a panel needs to show information that doesn't come from a
# Blender property, it gets that data from one of these classes. This separation
# of "fetching data" and "displaying data" is a common concept that makes UI
# code much simpler, more efficient, and less error-prone to refresh data.

import blenderbim.tool as tool


# All data must have a refresh function. The refresh function simply sets all
# data class to be not yet loaded. So the next time the interface is drawn to
# the user, it will force the data to be reloaded.
def refresh():
    # When you define your own data classes, just add to this list!
    DemoData.is_loaded = False


# This is a sample data class. It correlates to a single interface panel. Panels
# should not share data classes. This makes it easy to write your interface
# without having your code mixed in with other parts of the interface. As a
# convention, the class is named the same name as the panel.
class DemoData:
    # All data classes must have two variables. One to store all the data it has
    # loaded and another to store the load state.
    data = {}
    is_loaded = False

    # Every data class must have a load function. This lets us load data in a
    # predictable manner.
    @classmethod
    def load(cls):
        # The load function always has two responsibilities: populate the data,
        # and set is_loaded to true.
        cls.data = {
            "has_project": cls.has_project(),
            "project_name": cls.project_name(),

        # Blender session.

        # Imagine how messy our UI code would be if all of this was mixed in
        # with our layout code. Here, it's isolated and testable, and the UX
        # becomes easier to maintain and change.
