# Hey there! Welcome to the BlenderBIM Add-on code. Please feel free to reach
# out if you have any questions or need further guidance. Happy hacking!

# Every module has a ui.py file to define its interface. Interfaces describe how
# panels, buttons, labels, and input fields are laid out.

import bpy
from blenderbim.bim.module.demo.data import DemoData

# Every panel in the interface correlates to one of these classes. If you enable
# the "Developer Extras" option in Blender, then you can actually right click on
# any panel in Blender, and click "Edit Source". This will bring you to a ui.py
# file like this one where you can see this code. Pretty neat!
class BIM_PT_demo(bpy.types.Panel):
    # Every panel has a title.
    bl_label = "BlenderBIM Demo"

    # Every panel must have an ID. It must be unique. For example, you may want
    # to later reference the panel (such as if you want to create a nested
    # subpanel).
    bl_idname = "BIM_PT_demo"

    # This tells the panel to appear in the properties section (in the bottom
    # right by default) of the Blender interface.
    bl_space_type = "PROPERTIES"
    bl_region_type = "WINDOW"

    # This tells the panel to appear in the "scene" tab of the properties panel.
    bl_context = "scene"

    # Every panel has a draw function. This draws all the layout of the panel,
    # including all of its labels, buttons, and so on. Note that if the panel is
    # hidden, this draw function will not be called.
    def draw(self, context):
        # Before drawing any content, the panel must load any dynamic variables
        # that it will show. Most panels have dynamic content, which display
        # changing data from your BIM model. You must load that data first. The
        # two lines are always the same, "if not loaded, then load".

            # Each panel should have its own data class that it loads data from.
            # Note that we only load data if it hasn't already been loaded.
            # This is because interface panels are drawn continuously. This
            # draw() function will be called every time you scroll or move your
            # mouse over it. Loading data is slow, so we only refresh data when
            # we have to.
            DemoData.load()

        # the properties are stored for the module.

        # new line.
        row = self.layout.row()

        # side panel.

        # Our interface can contain simple logic. For example, if we don't have
        # an IFC project, show an error message and don't draw anything else.
        # The ui.py should always have very simple logic. Details like how to
        # determine whether we have a project is delegated to the data loader.

        # Blender properties can be used to affect what your panel shows. Notice

        # about text input fields, number sliders, dropdowns, checkboxes, and
        # scrollable lists? The way Blender works is that you simply show a
        # Blender property in your interface. The data type of that property
        # determines which UI widget is shown. A text property will show a text
        # field. A number property will show a number slider. An enum property
        # will show a drop down. And so on. In this case, our name property is a
        # text data type, so expect to see a text input field show up here.
