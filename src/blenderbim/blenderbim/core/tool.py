# ############################################################################ #

# Hey there! Welcome to the BlenderBIM Add-on code. Please feel free to reach
# out if you have any questions or need further guidance. Happy hacking!

# ############################################################################ #

# This portion of the code is singled out as it is part of the Demo module, used
# to teach people how the code is structured in the BlenderBIM Add-on.

# This is an example "interface" (as in, a software interface, not a user
# interface) for the Demo module. Think of it as a list of all of the functions
# your module can perform. In this file, you will come across every single
# capability of the entire add-on. By breaking it down into little functions, we
# can test each one separately, and at a glance know if there are opportunities
# for code reuse or refactoring. At this point, we're only interested in a list
# of functions, not the details of how they're implemented. This is because the
# purpose of the core is to just give a high level overview of the application's
# capabilities.
