# Hey there! Welcome to the BlenderBIM Add-on code. Please feel free to reach
# out if you have any questions or need further guidance. Happy hacking!

# Every module has a tool file which implements all the functions that the core
# needs. Whereas the core is simply high level code, the tool file has the
# concrete implementations, dealing with exactly how things interact with
# Blender's property systems, IFC's data structures, the filesystem, geometry
# processing, and more.

import bpy
import blenderbim.core.tool
import blenderbim.tool as tool


# There is always one class in each tool file, which implements the interface
# defined by `core/tool.py`.
class Demo(blenderbim.core.tool.Demo):
    @classmethod
    def clear_name_field(cls):
        # In this concrete implementation, we see that "clear name field"
        # actually translates to "set this Blender string property to empty
        # string". In this case, it's pretty simple - but even simple scenarios
        # like these are important to implement in the tool, as it makes the
        # pseudocode easier to read in the core, and makes it easier to test
        # implementations separately from control flow. It also makes it easy to
        # refactor and share functions, where every tool function is captured by
        # a function name that describes its intention.
