""" This script regenerates all drawing paths in case they have been created in a different operating system.

It is useful when an annotation drawing has been created on windows and you want to recreate the
drawig in linux.
In this case, blenderbim would tell you that can't load "stylesheet" or "markers" or "symbols" or "patterns" folder.
If this happens, this script comes in rescue!
Basically, as the path is stored in a string, the script replaces the existing sep char with the right one.
It works on the active ifc file (if exists).
