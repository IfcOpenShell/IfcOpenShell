System support
==============

The BlenderBIM Add-on officially supports all major 64-bit platforms, as well as
the Python version shipped by the Blender Foundation for the most recent three
major Blender versions:

- 64-bit Linux on Python 3.10
- 64-bit MacOS on Python 3.10
- 64-bit MacOS M1 on Python 3.10
- 64-bit Windows on Python 3.10

Note that developer builds may exist for older versions of Python but there will
be no guarantee of the uptime or stability of these builds.

Other system specifications match the `Blender Requirements
<https://www.blender.org/download/requirements/>`_.
