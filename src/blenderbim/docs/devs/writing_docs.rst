Writing docs
============

A great way to contribute without writing code is to help writing
documentation. Please reach out before contributing as the software is still in
an alpha state and portions may not be worth documenting as it changes too
frequently.

Writing technical documentation
-------------------------------

All documentation is written in ReStructured Text and is available in the
`BlenderBIM Add-on docs directory
<https://github.com/IfcOpenShell/IfcOpenShell/tree/v0.7.0/src/blenderbim/docs>`_.

The following colours and annotation styles should be used for annotating
images. All stroke widths are 3px with a corner radius of 3px.  Horizontal
underlines are 5px with a corner radius of 2px. The dark green is **39b54a** and
the light green is **d9e021**.
