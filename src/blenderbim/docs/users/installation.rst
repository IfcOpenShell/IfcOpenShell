Installation
============

1. **Download and install Blender**

   Blender is a free and open-source program for 3D authoring. It works on
   Linux, Mac, and Windows. It is developed by the Blender community.

   The BlenderBIM Add-on extends Blender with OpenBIM related capabilities.

    If you are a poweruser, you may be interested in the **Unstable installation** to help with testing. :doc:`Read more <../devs/installation>`

.. _where is the add-on installed:

Where is the add-on installed?
------------------------------

Upon installation, the BlenderBIM Add-on is stored in the
``scripts/addons/blenderbim/`` directory, within your Blender configuration
folder. However, the location of your Blender configuration folder depends on
how you have installed Blender.

If you downloaded Blender as a ``.zip`` file without running an installer, you
will find the Blender configuration folder in the following directory, where
``X.XX`` is the Blender version:
::

    /path/to/blender/X.XX/

Otherwise, if you installed Blender using an installation package, the Blender
configuration folder depends on which operating system you use.

On Linux, if you are installing the add-on as a user:
::

    ~/.config/blender/X.XX/

On Linux, if you are deploying the add-on system-wide (this may also depend on
your Linux distribution):
::

    /usr/share/blender/X.XX/

On Mac, if you are installing the add-on as a user:
::

    /Users/{YOUR_USER}/Library/Application Support/Blender/X.XX/

On Mac, if you are deploying the add-on system-wide:

::

    /Library/Application Support/Blender/X.XX/

On Windows:
::

    C:\Users\{YOUR_USER}\AppData\Roaming\Blender Foundation\X.XX\

Updating
--------

First uninstall the current BlenderBIM add-on, then install the latest version.

Uninstalling
------------

Navigate to ``Edit > Preferences > Add-ons``. Due to a limitation in Blender,
you have to first disable the BlenderBIM Add-on in your Blender preferences by
pressing the checkbox next to the add-on, then restart Blender. After
restarting, you can uninstall the BlenderBIM Add-on by pressing the ``Remove``
button in the Blender preferences window.

Alternatively, you may uninstall manually by deleting the ``blenderbim/``
directory in your Blender add-ons directory.

.. warning::

    It is important to follow the sequence of disabling, restarting, then removing.
    If you do not restart Blender, the add-on will fail to remove correctly, and you
    will need to uninstall manually.


FAQ
---

1. **I get an error similar to "ImportError: IfcOpenShell not built for 'linux/64bit/python3.7'"**

   Check which BlenderBIM Add-on build you are using. The zip will have either
   ``py37``, ``py39``, or ``py310`` in the name. See the instructions in the
   **Unstable installation** section to check that you have installed the
   correct version.

2. **I am on Ubuntu and get an error similar to "ImportError: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libm.so.6: version GLIBC_2.29 not found"**

   Our latest package which uses IfcOpenShell v0.7.0 is built using Ubuntu 20 LTS.
   If you have an older Ubuntu version, you can either upgrade to 19.10 or above,
   or you'll need to compile IfcOpenShell yourself.

3. **Some other error prevents me from installing or doing basic functions with
   the add-on. Is it specific to my environment?**

   Sometimes it is helpful to try installing and using the BlenderBIM Add-on on
   a "clean environment". A clean environment is defined as a fresh Blender
   installation with no other add-ons enabled with factory settings.

   To quickly test in a clean environment, find your Blender configuration
   folder based on the `where is the add-on installed`_ section. Rename the
   folder from ``X.XX`` to something else like ``X.XX_backup``, then restart
   Blender and try follow the installation instructions again.

   If this fixes your issue, consider disabling other add-ons one by one until
   you find a conflict as a next step to isolating the issue.
