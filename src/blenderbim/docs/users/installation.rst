.. _where is the add-on installed:

Updating
--------

First follow the `Uninstalling`_ section below, then install the latest version.

Uninstalling
------------

Navigate to ``Edit > Preferences > Add-ons``. Due to a limitation in Blender,
you have to **first disable the BlenderBIM Add-on in your Blender preferences**
by pressing the checkbox next to the add-on, then **restart Blender**. It is
critical to follow this sequence of disabling first, and then restarting.

After restarting, you can uninstall the BlenderBIM Add-on by pressing the
``Remove`` button in the Blender preferences window.

Alternatively, you may uninstall manually by deleting the ``blenderbim``
directory in :ref:`your Blender add-ons directory<where is the add-on
installed>`.

.. warning::

    It is important to follow the sequence of disabling, restarting, then removing.
    If you do not restart Blender, the add-on will fail to remove correctly, and you
    will need to uninstall manually.

Where is the add-on installed?
------------------------------

Upon installation, the BlenderBIM Add-on is stored in the
``scripts/addons/blenderbim/`` directory, within your Blender configuration
folder. However, the location of your Blender configuration folder depends on
how you have installed Blender.

If you downloaded Blender as a ``.zip`` file without running an installer, the
BlenderBIM Add-on will be installed in the following directory, where ``X.XX``
is the Blender version:

::

    /path/to/blender/X.XX/scripts/addons/blenderbim/

Otherwise, if you installed Blender using an installation package, the Blender
configuration folder depends on which operating system you use.

On Linux, if you are installing the add-on as a user:

::

    ~/.config/blender/X.XX/scripts/addons/blenderbim/

On Linux, if you are deploying the add-on system-wide (this may also depend on
your Linux distribution):

::

    /usr/share/blender/X.XX/scripts/addons/blenderbim/

On Mac, if you are installing the add-on as a user:

::

    /Users/{YOUR_USER}/Library/Application Support/Blender/X.XX/scripts/addons/blenderbim/

On Mac, if you are deploying the add-on system-wide:

::

    /Library/Application Support/Blender/X.XX/scripts/addons/blenderbim/

On Windows:

::

    C:\Users\{YOUR_USER}\AppData\Roaming\Blender Foundation\X.XX\scripts\addons\blenderbim\
