BlenderBIM Interface Guide
============================

Introduction
============

The BlenderBIM interface extends Blender's powerful 3D environment with specialized tools for Building Information Modeling (BIM). This guide will help you navigate the BlenderBIM interface and understand its key components.

BlenderBIM Workspace
====================

When you start Blender with BlenderBIM installed, you can switch to the BlenderBIM workspace
by clicking on the BIM workspace tab at the top of the Blender window.

This workspace is preconfigured with the most commonly used panels and tools for BIM workflows.


Key Interface Elements
======================

Properties Extended
-------------------

The Properties Editor is extended to provide IFC-specific properties and settings.

- Scene
  - Project Information
- Tool
- Object

BIM Toolbar
-----------

The BIM toolbar, typically located at the left of the 3D Viewport, contains shortcuts to frequently used BIM tools:

- Explore tool
- Create various building elements
- Create annotations, measure distance and angles, calculate volumes, etc


IFC Tree View
-------------

Found in the Outliner, the IFC Tree View displays the hierarchical structure of your BIM model:

- Spatial Structure (Site, Building, Storey)
- Building Elements
- Types

Customizing the Interface
=========================

BlenderBIM respects Blender's highly customizable interface. You can:

- Rearrange editors and panels
- Save custom workspace layouts
- Create custom shortcuts for BIM operations

Tips for Efficient Use
======================

1. Familiarize yourself with IFC classes and their properties.
2. Utilize Blender's search function (F3) to quickly access BlenderBIM tools.


Next Steps
==========

Now that you're familiar with the BlenderBIM interface, you have two main paths to continue your learning:

1. Proceed with IFC Modeling:
   If you're ready to start creating and working with BIM models, you can move on to:

   - :doc:`IFC Modeling Basics </users/modeling/ifc_modeling>`

2. Dive deeper into the User Interface:
   If you want to explore more details about the BlenderBIM interface, you can refer to:

   - :doc:`User Interface Reference </users/user_interface>`

Choose the path that best suits your current needs and learning style. You can always come back to explore the other option later.

Remember, as you become more comfortable with the interface and basic modeling, you can explore more advanced topics such as:

- :doc:`Generating Documentation </users/drawing/index>`
- :doc:`Advanced BIM Techniques </users/advanced/index>`

The BlenderBIM interface is designed to integrate seamlessly with Blender while providing powerful BIM-specific functionality.
As you progress, you'll find your BIM workflow becoming increasingly efficient and productive.
