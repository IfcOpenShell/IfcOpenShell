============
IFC modeling
============

This chapter covers the essential aspects of working with Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) in BlenderBIM. It is divided into five main sections:

.. only:: builder_html and (not singlehtml)

   .. container:: toc-cards

      .. container:: card

         :doc:`understanding_ifc`
            An introduction to IFC standards, schemas, and concepts.
            This section explains the structure of IFC data, key spatial objects, and the role of organizations
            like buildingSMART in maintaining IFC standards. It also covers IfcOpenShell and the broader ecosystem
            of open standards in the AEC industry.


      .. container:: card

         :doc:`importing_viewing_models`
            A guide on how to import existing IFC models into BlenderBIM and navigate them effectively.
            This section includes techniques for inspecting and querying IFC data within the BlenderBIM environment.


      .. container:: card

         :doc:`starting_new_project`
            Instructions on creating and setting up a new IFC project from scratch in BlenderBIM.
            This covers initial project setup, including advanced options for more complex projects.

      .. container:: card

         :doc:`basic_modeling/index`
          An exploration of fundamental IFC modeling techniques, including:
              - Creating walls
              - Adding doors and windows
              - Modeling slabs and roofs
              - Defining rooms and spaces

      .. container:: card

         :doc:`advanced_modeling/index`
            A deep dive into more complex modeling techniques for experienced users, including:
              - Creating custom parametric wall types
              - Modeling furniture and fixtures
              - Working with structural elements
              - Designing multi-story buildings
              - Modeling complex structures
