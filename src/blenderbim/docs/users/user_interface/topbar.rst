- New Imperial (ft) Project: Creates a new IFC project using feet as the base unit.
- New Demo Project: Creates a new IFC project with pre-populated demo content.
- New Project Wizard: Creates a default Blender project (including the default cube)
  and opens the Scene Properties > Project Overview > Project Info tab.
