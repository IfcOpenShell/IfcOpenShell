Dealing with large models
=========================

The BlenderBIM Add-on can handle large models, or federated collections of
models where the combined total IFCs may be many gigabytes or object counts may
be in the hundreds of thousands.

Models may be large in terms of different metrics, such as:

- Filesizes over 750MB, which may cause memory issues
- Individual object polygon counts over 100k, which may cause unreasonable
  loading times
- Objects having excessive or low quality booleans, which may cause
  unreasonable loading times
- Number of elements exceeding 50,000 loaded in the scene, which may cause
  unreasonable loading times, selection glitches, and viewport lagging

There are always solutions to all of these, but an understanding of the type of
size limitation you are up against will always help.

Large filesizes
---------------

The first priority is to ensure you do not have a prohibitively large filesize.

- Use IFC4. It can handle geometry much more efficiently and expect your
  filesize to drop significantly.
- When coming from other software, ensure you are exporting solids, not faceted
  BReps or tessellations where appropriate. Choosing the wrong export setting
  can easily double or triple your filesize and export times. Choose **Design
  Transfer View** instead of **Coordination View** or **Reference View**. Look
  for export settings that use the keywords like "surface", "solid", "brep",
  "tessellation", or "extrusion".
- Improve your model breakdown strategy (see below)
- Identify objects with large polygon counts and improve the modeling (see below)

Model breakdown strategies
--------------------------

A good general strategy is to never have a large model to begin with. Breaking
down models is critical for usability during design and coordination. Where full
models are needed, such as during clash detection, review meetings, or client
handover, many small models may be federated. Model breakdown strategies
include:

- **By discipline**, you probably already do this, so let's move on
- **By location**, such as by building, floor, zone, mid-rise, high-rise, core
  podium, underground, plant rooms, facade orientation, or similar.
- **By object type**, such as by primary structural elements vs accessories
  (plates, bolts, etc), furniture vs general arrangement, facade vs interiors,
  distribution system elements (equipment, pipes, fittings) vs accessories (pipe
  clamps, hangers, etc) or similar.
- **By coordination task**, many people get into the habit of exchanging the
  entire building when a task only requires a tiny portion of it. Think of the
  workflow of exchanging traditional drawings. A large project would have
  thousands of drawings with a few drawings exchanged for a single coordination
  task. This strategy can be used with models: exchange hundreds of tiny models
  (some maybe even only 1MB!), scoped to the task at hand. Keep exchanges small
  and frequent (like code commits, for the geeks reading this).

Filtered model loading
----------------------

You may filter elements and only load a portion of the model. Click on 
:ref:`Enable Advanced Mode <Project Info Advanced Loading Mode>` checkbox when loading a model.


.. image:: images/advanced-mode.png

This will preload the model and present you with model loading options in the
:doc:`Project Info </users/user_interface/property_editor/scene_editor/project_overview/project_info>`
panel.

**Filter Modes** include:

- **Decomposition**, filter by location in the building, such as **Level 1** or
  **Building A**.
- **IFC Class**, filter by IFC class, such as **Wall**, **Column**, or **Pipe
  Segments**
- **IFC Type**, filter by IFC construction type, such as **Copper pipes** and
  **200mm thick concrete slabs**
- **Whitelist** or **Blacklist**, filter by a custom query

When **Whitelist** or **Blacklist** is chosen, you may type a custom query to
filter by attributes, properties, location, and so on.

Large polygon counts
--------------------

If objects with large polygon counts are blocking you from importing, consider
enabling **Native Meshes** in the :ref:`Advanced Loading Mode <Project Info Advanced Loading Mode>` when loading projects.

The **Debug Panel** allows you to **Select High Polygon Meshes** or **Select
Highest Polygon Meshes** to isolate geometrically complex objects by a polygon
number threshold or a percentage.

After selecting these elements, you can view them in edit mode to see a polygon
count and where the offending polygons are. Often, fixing a single object may
cut out 50MB.

Excessive or low quality booleans
---------------------------------

In some cases, elements may be generated from external software with an
excessive (over 50) number of boolean operations or with high polygon, complex
booleans.

The **IFC Debug** panel has a **Test All Shapes** feature which generates
geometry for every element one by one and outputs the processing time to the
console. When you see it stuck on an element, make a note of the element ID. You
may then use the **IFC Debug** panel's **Inspector** to determine the nature of
the boolean, or create a **Blacklist Filter Mode** to exclude the element from
import.

These types of errors are usually problems with external software (i.e. not
intentionally by the end-user) and typically do not affect critical geometry
and can be worked around.

Fully resolving boolean issues is a complex case by case topic and not covered
here.

High number of elements
-----------------------

Click on :ref:`Enable Advanced Mode <Project Info Advanced Loading Mode>`  when loading a model and you will be presented
with model loading options in the **Project Info** panel.

You may specify an **Element Range** to process. The **Element Offset** says the
first element to start processing at, and the **Element Limit** says how many
elements should be processed. For example, in a model with 100,000 objects, an
**Element Start** of 30,000 and an **Element Limit** of 20,000 will process the
elements starting at item number 30,000 and ending at item number 50,000. This
allows you to arbitrarily break down large models into submodels. This can be
combined with other filters.

Using Blender 3.3 and above will result in a faster load time (~50%) compared to
older Blender versions.

Coordination only models
------------------------

The BlenderBIM Add-on defaults to authoring IFCs. This allows full editing and
inspection of all element properties and relationships. However, sometimes only
geometry and basic attributes such as names are sufficient. Example usecases
include CG visualisation, overall federated model coordination, or pure
geometric checks.

Click on :ref:`Enable Advanced Mode <Project Info Advanced Loading Mode>` checkbox when loading a model and you will be presented
with model loading options in the **Project Info** panel. Enable **For
Coordination Only**, which will exclude non geometric elements, openings, and
types from being imported. This leads to slightly faster imports, and a
decreased object count.

Enabling **For Coordination Only** also allows you to specify a **Merge Mode**.
This combines objects to keep object counts low. Blender is very good at
handling less objects with more complexity, rather than the other way around.
When a **Merge Mode** is activated, import times will increase (~50%) but object
counts will be drastically reduced, which is critical for the federation of
large models. **Merge Modes** include:

- **IFC Class**, where objects of the same IFC class are merged. This is useful
  if you have models where only the class is meaningful for other disciplines,
  such as structural models.
- **IFC Type**, where objects of the same construction type are merged. This is
  useful where the main identification of interest is the element type, not the
  element instance.
- **Material**, where objects of the same material are merged. This is useful if
  the model is used for purely visual exploration such as CG visualisation.

Once loaded, the model may be saved as a ``.blend`` file for subsequent loads.
You can think of the ``.blend`` file as a geometry cache, which is very, very
fast to load. If it no longer necessary to access IFC data, consider pressing
the **Unload Project** icon so that future loads of the ``.blend`` file will be
very fast.

With these strategies, a federated 1GB IFC model can easily load in 10 seconds
from the saved Blender files.

Processing models headlessly
----------------------------

You can automate model processing using this command (~5% speedup):

.. code-block:: bash

    $ blender -b -P headless_import.py

The ``headless_import.py`` script contains instructions on how to configure
model loading settings.
