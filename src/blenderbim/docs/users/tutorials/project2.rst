Project 2: Building a Bungalow
==============================

In this project, we'll take your BlenderBIM skills to the next level by designing a complete bungalow.
You'll learn about roof design, advanced foundations, structural elements, and more complex MEP systems.
We'll also introduce basic costing and scheduling concepts.

Prerequisites
=============

- Completion of Project 1: Designing a Flat
- Good understanding of BlenderBIM's basic and intermediate features

Learning Objectives
===================

- Design and model a complete roof structure
- Create advanced foundations
- Incorporate structural elements
- Model roof openings and dormers
- Design underground services
- Create running services in subfloor space
- Generate detailed drawings
- Introduce basic costing and scheduling

Tutorial Steps
==============

1. Project Initialization
-------------------------

1. Set up a new IFC project for the bungalow
2. Define project parameters (site conditions, climate zone, etc.)
3. Create a basic site plan

2. Advanced Foundation Design
-----------------------------

1. Model foundation walls and footings
2. Create a slab-on-grade foundation
3. Add insulation and damp-proofing elements
4. Model foundation vents and access points

3. Structural Elements
----------------------

1. Add load-bearing walls
2. Incorporate steel or wooden beams and columns
3. Model floor joists and subfloor
4. Create lintels for openings

4. Roof Design
--------------

1. Choose a roof style (gable, hip, combination)
2. Model roof trusses or rafters
3. Add roof sheathing and finishing materials
4. Create eaves, fascias, and soffits

5. Roof Openings and Dormers
----------------------------

1. Design and place skylights
2. Create chimney openings
3. Model dormers (if applicable)
4. Add roof vents

6. Underground Services
-----------------------

1. Design and model a septic system or sewer connection
2. Create water supply lines
3. Add electrical service entrance
4. Model gas lines (if applicable)

7. Subfloor Services
--------------------

1. Design HVAC ductwork in the subfloor space
2. Create plumbing runs
3. Model electrical conduits
4. Add insulation between floor joists

8. Interior and Exterior Finishes
---------------------------------

1. Apply wall finishes (drywall, plaster, etc.)
2. Add flooring materials
3. Model ceiling finishes
4. Create exterior cladding (siding, brick, stone)

9. MEP Systems
--------------

1. Design a more complex electrical system
2. Create a comprehensive HVAC layout
3. Model a complete plumbing system
4. Add smart home or security system elements

10. Detailed Drawings
---------------------

1. Generate foundation plans
2. Create framing plans (floor and roof)
3. Produce detailed sections showing construction assemblies
4. Design detail drawings for complex junctions (roof-wall, foundation-wall)

11. Basic Costing
-----------------

1. Assign basic cost data to building elements
2. Create a simple bill of quantities
3. Generate a basic cost estimate

12. Introduction to Scheduling
------------------------------

1. Break down the project into basic construction phases
2. Assign durations to major tasks
3. Create a simple Gantt chart

13. Final Steps and Export
--------------------------

1. Review and refine all IFC properties
2. Generate a complete set of drawings
3. Create a basic project manual with drawings, cost estimate, and schedule

Conclusion
==========

Congratulations on designing a complete bungalow!
You've now expanded your skills to include more complex architectural and engineering concepts,
as well as basic project management tools.

Next Steps
==========

- Experiment with different bungalow styles and layouts
- Dive deeper into structural engineering concepts
- Explore more advanced MEP system designs
- Learn about energy modeling and sustainability features
- Develop more detailed cost estimates and construction schedules

In the next project, we'll scale up to a multi-story single-family home, introducing concepts like complex roofs,
advanced MEP systems, and basic site landscaping.
