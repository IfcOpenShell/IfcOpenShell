Project 0: Designing a Room
===========================

In this introductory project, you'll learn the basics of using BlenderBIM to design a simple room. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have created a basic 3D model and a 2D floor plan drawing.

Prerequisites
=============

- Basic knowledge of Blender interface
- BlenderBIM Add-on installed and activated

Learning Objectives
===================

- Create basic walls and openings
- Add a floor slab
- Incorporate basic MEP elements
- Place basic furniture
- Generate a simple floor plan drawing

Tutorial Steps
==============

1. Setting Up the Project
-------------------------

1. Open Blender and switch to the BlenderBIM workspace
2. Set up the project settings (units, scale, etc.)
3. Create a new IFC project

2. Creating Walls
-----------------

1. Use the "Create Wall" tool to draw the room's perimeter
2. Adjust wall heights and thicknesses
3. Add interior walls if needed

3. Adding Openings
------------------

1. Create a door opening using the "Add Opening" tool
2. Add a window opening
3. Adjust opening dimensions and positions

4. Creating the Floor Slab
--------------------------

1. Use the "Create Slab" tool to add a floor
2. Adjust slab thickness and elevation

5. Basic MEP Elements
---------------------

1. Add electrical outlets using IFC Electric Terminal
2. Place a light fixture using IFC Lighting Fixture
3. Add a simple HVAC vent using IFC Flow Terminal

6. Placing Furniture
--------------------

1. Import basic furniture from the BlenderBIM library
2. Position and rotate furniture items
3. Adjust furniture properties if needed

7. Generating a Floor Plan
--------------------------

1. Set up a plan view using the BlenderBIM drawing tools
2. Add dimensions to the floor plan
3. Include basic annotations and labels

8. Finish
---------

1. Review IFC properties for all elements
2. Generate a PDF of the floor plan drawing

Conclusion
==========

Congratulations! You've completed your first room design using BlenderBIM. You should now have a basic understanding of creating walls, openings, slabs, and simple MEP elements, as well as generating a basic floor plan.

Next Steps
==========

- Experiment with different room layouts and furniture arrangements
- Try creating a more complex room shape
- Explore additional MEP elements and their properties

In the next project, we'll build upon these skills to design a complete flat, introducing more advanced concepts and techniques.
