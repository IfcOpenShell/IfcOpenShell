Other add-ons
=============

Blender has a large ecosystem of add-ons. The BlenderBIM Add-on is one of many
add-ons which provide utility to the architecture, engineering, and construction
industry.

Some of these add-ons come with Blender and merely need to be enabled in the
``Edit > Preferences > Add-ons`` tab.

- **Sun Position** - will allow you to set the correct location of the sun and
  true north. Integrates with IFC4 georeferencing features in the BlenderBIM
  Add-on.
- **AutoCAD DXF Format (.dxf)** - provides import and export support of the DXF
  format in Blender.
- **tinyCAD Mesh tools** - provides basic intersection and circle reconstruction
  utilities similar to trim / extend / centroid tools in CAD tools.

Some of these add-ons are not shipped with Blender:

- `CAD Transform for Blender <https://gumroad.com/l/nqvcs>`__ - This will
  provide CAD snapping, move, rotate, and scale functions in Blender. This is
  highly recommended for precision modeling in Blender.
- `Blender Archipack <https://blender-archipack.org/>`__ - Archipack lets you
  create parametric architectural objects, like walls, floors, ceilings, doors,
  roofs, and furniture with a single click from a preset templates. It
  integrates with the BlenderBIM Add-on, so you have the choice to combine both
  parametric and modeling by hand.
- `Sverchok <https://github.com/nortikin/sverchok/>`__ - Sverchok is a visual
  programming add-on for Blender that allows you to generate parametric
  geometry, create scripts for non-programmers, model solids from FreeCAD, and
  much more.
- `BlenderGIS <https://github.com/domlysz/BlenderGIS>`__ - BlenderGIS lets you
  import GIS data, grab elevation data from the web, and generate TINs from
  survey points and contours.
- `Ladybug Tools for Blender
  <https://blenderbim.org/builds/ladybug-blender-220127.zip>`__ - Ladybug Tools
  is an extension of Sverchok for environmental analysis and building physics
  simulation. It allows analysis of solar, daylight, energy, and CFD.
- `Topologic <https://topologic.app/>`__ - Perform spatial and topological
  analysis of simplified building geometry and space connectivity.
- `Speckle Blender <https://speckle.systems/tag/blender/>`__ - Use Speckle to
  get your designs in Blender from other CAD software.
- `Point Cloud Visualizer <https://blendermarket.com/products/pcv>`__ - Display,
  edit, filter, render, convert, generate and export colored point cloud PLY
  files.
- `MeasureIt_ARCH <https://github.com/kevancress/MeasureIt_ARCH>`__ - Simple
  dimensioning and annotation tools in Blender.
- `Sorcar <https://aachman98.itch.io/sorcar>`__ - Another visual node
  programming alternative to Sverchok.
