"""Saikei Civil Core Module

This module contains pure Python business logic with NO Blender (bpy) dependencies.
All functions here must be testable outside of Blender.

Following Bonsai's architecture pattern:
- core/ = Pure Python logic, receives tool classes as parameters
- tool/ = Blender implementations with bpy
- civil/ = UI layer (operators, panels, properties)
