This chapter covers the essential aspects of working with Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) in Bonsai. It is divided into five main sections:

.. only:: builder_html and (not singlehtml)

   .. container:: toc-cards

      .. container:: card

         :doc:`understanding_ifc`
            An introduction to IFC standards, schemas, and concepts.
            This section explains the structure of IFC data, key spatial objects, and the role of organizations
            like buildingSMART in maintaining IFC standards. It also covers IfcOpenShell and the broader ecosystem
            of open standards in the AEC industry.


      .. container:: card

         :doc:`importing_viewing_models`
            A guide on how to import existing IFC models into Bonsai and navigate them effectively.
            This section includes techniques for inspecting and querying IFC data within the Bonsai environment.


      .. container:: card

         :doc:`starting_new_project`
