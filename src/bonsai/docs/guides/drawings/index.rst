Drawings and documents
======================

Bonsai provides powerful tools for generating 2D drawings from your 3D BIM models and adding detailed annotations.
This section covers the process of creating various types of drawings and enhancing them with annotations.

Prerequisites
=============

Before starting with 2D drafting:

1. Ensure you have completed the IFC modeling section or have a completed IFC model ready.
2. Install and update to the latest compatible version of Bonsai as the Drafting module is still in early development.
3. Install InkScape as the drafting is heavily based on SVG files.

After mastering these basics, you may want to explore:

- Generating elevations and sections
- Creating detail drawings
- Setting up custom hatch patterns and line styles
- Advanced annotation techniques

Remember, effective drawings are key to communicating your design intent.
Take time to explore the various options and develop a consistent style for your project documentation.
