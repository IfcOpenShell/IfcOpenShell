   - Drag the plane to adjust its position.
   - Add multiple clipping planes simultaneously for complex views.

- **Flip Clipping Plane** (Shortcut: :kbd:`Shift` + :kbd:`F`): Reverse the direction of the active clipping plane.


Usage
-----

1. Activate the tool from the toolbar or use the shortcut.
2. Select the element you want to interact with.
3. Select the desired option by pressing the corresponding shortcut.
4. Interact with your model in the 3D viewport:

   * For Walk Mode, use WASD or arrow keys to move through the model.

The Explore Tool significantly enhances the model navigation and inspection capabilities of Bonsai.
It's particularly useful for understanding spatial relationships, inspecting building cross-sections, and navigating through complex interiors.
These features make Bonsai more comparable to dedicated IFC viewers while retaining its powerful authoring capabilities.
