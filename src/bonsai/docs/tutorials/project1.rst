Project 1: Designing a Flat
===========================

Building on the skills from Project 0, this tutorial will guide you through designing a complete flat using Bonsai.
You'll learn more advanced techniques for creating walls and openings, working with profiles, defining rooms and spaces,
and generating more detailed drawings.

Prerequisites
=============

- Completion of Project 0: Designing a Room
- Familiarity with basic Bonsai tools and interface

Learning Objectives
===================

- Create advanced walls and openings
- Work with profiles for custom architectural elements
- Define and manage rooms and spaces
- Use furniture and fixture libraries
- Generate elevation and section drawings

Tutorial Steps
==============

1. Project Setup
----------------

1. Open Blender and switch to the Bonsai workspace
2. Create a new IFC project
3. Save it as `project1.ifc` file (and optionally, `project1.blend` file)
4. Load custom libraries and templates

.. note:: See :doc:`/users/modeling/starting_new_project` for detailed instructions.

2. Advanced Wall Creation
-------------------------

1. Use the "Create Wall" tool to layout the flat's exterior walls
2. Add interior walls with varying thicknesses
3. Create curved walls for architectural interest
4. Apply different materials to walls

3. Complex Openings
-------------------

1. Add various door types (sliding, pocket, double)
2. Create windows with different styles (casement, sliding, bay)
3. Design a balcony door with sidelight windows
4. Add skylights or clerestory windows if applicable

4. Working with Profiles
------------------------

1. Create a custom cornice profile
2. Design a baseboard profile
3. Apply profiles to walls and openings
4. Create a custom handrail profile for stairs or balcony

5. Defining Rooms and Spaces
----------------------------

1. Use the "Create Space" tool to define individual rooms
2. Set room names and numbers
3. Calculate and display room areas
4. Assign room finishes (flooring, wall finishes, ceiling)

6. Using Furniture and Fixture Libraries
----------------------------------------

1. Import furniture from Bonsai libraries
2. Place and arrange furniture in each room
3. Add plumbing fixtures (sinks, toilets, bathtub/shower)
4. Include kitchen appliances and cabinetry

7. MEP Systems
--------------

1. Design basic electrical layout (outlets, switches, lighting)
2. Add HVAC elements (vents, radiators)
3. Create a simple plumbing system

8. Stairs and Railings
----------------------

1. Design an internal staircase (if multi-level flat)
2. Add railings to stairs and balcony
3. Create landings and adjust riser/tread dimensions

9. Generating Drawings
----------------------

1. Create floor plans for each level
2. Generate elevation drawings (front, back, sides)
3. Produce section drawings through key areas
4. Add dimensions, annotations, and labels to all drawings

10. Final Touches and Export
----------------------------

1. Review and adjust IFC properties for all elements
2. Create a basic materials and finishes schedule
3. Generate a set of PDF drawings

Conclusion
==========

Congratulations on completing the flat design! You've now expanded your skills to include more complex architectural elements, space planning, and detailed drawing generation.

Next Steps
==========

- Experiment with different flat layouts and styles
- Try creating custom families for unique furniture or fixtures
- Explore more advanced MEP systems
- Learn about creating custom annotation styles for drawings

In the next project, we'll scale up to design a full bungalow, introducing concepts like roof design, foundations, and basic structural elements.
