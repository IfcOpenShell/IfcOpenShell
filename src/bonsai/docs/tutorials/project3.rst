Project 3: Multi-Storey Single-Family Home
==========================================

In this project, we'll design a multi-storey single-family home using Bonsai.
This tutorial will introduce more advanced concepts such as templating, complex roofs, and sophisticated MEP systems.
We'll also touch on basic site landscaping.

Prerequisites
=============

- Completion of Project 2: Building a Bungalow
- Strong understanding of Bonsai's features and IFC concepts

Learning Objectives
===================

- Use templating for efficient design
- Work with types for consistent elements
- Design complex roof structures
- Model complex fixtures (e.g., solar panels)
- Create advanced HVAC, plumbing, and electrical systems
- Implement basic site landscaping

Tutorial Steps
==============

1. Project Setup and Templating
-------------------------------

1. Create a new IFC project for the multi-storey home
2. Set up project templates for walls, floors, and other common elements
3. Establish a grid system for the building

2. Building Shell Design
------------------------

1. Create the ground floor layout using templates
2. Design upper floors, incorporating different room layouts
3. Add staircases and elevator shafts
4. Model exterior walls with varied materials and insulation layers

3. Complex Roof Design
----------------------

1. Design a complex roof structure (e.g., combination of hip and gable)
2. Create dormers and other roof features
3. Model roof trusses or rafters for the complex shape
4. Add gutters and downspouts

4. Advanced Window and Door Types
---------------------------------

1. Create custom window types (e.g., bay windows, corner windows)
2. Design specialty doors (e.g., bifold patio doors, garage doors)
3. Implement window and door schedules

5. Complex Fixtures and Fittings
--------------------------------

1. Design and place solar panels on the roof
2. Create a complex kitchen layout with custom cabinetry
3. Model built-in furniture and storage solutions
4. Add smart home fixtures (e.g., automated blinds, security cameras)

6. Advanced HVAC System
-----------------------

1. Design a multi-zone HVAC system
2. Create a heat recovery ventilation system
3. Model ductwork and vents across multiple floors
4. Implement a radiant floor heating system

7. Complex Plumbing System
--------------------------

1. Design a multi-floor plumbing system
2. Create a greywater recycling system
3. Model hot water recirculation
4. Design an outdoor irrigation system

8. Advanced Electrical System
-----------------------------

1. Create a comprehensive electrical plan for all floors
2. Design a smart electrical panel
3. Implement a home automation system
4. Add an electric vehicle charging station

9. Structural Considerations
----------------------------

1. Model load-bearing walls and columns
2. Create floor and roof structural systems
3. Design foundation systems for the multi-storey structure
4. Implement seismic reinforcement elements (if applicable)

10. Energy Efficiency Features
------------------------------

1. Add high-performance insulation to walls and roof
2. Implement triple-pane windows
3. Design shading devices for sun control
4. Create a green roof section

11. Basic Site Landscaping
--------------------------

1. Model basic terrain around the house
2. Add driveways and walkways
3. Create simple vegetation (trees, shrubs, grass)
4. Design a basic water feature or pool

12. Advanced Drawings and Documentation
---------------------------------------

1. Generate multi-floor plans
2. Create detailed section drawings showing multi-storey construction
3. Produce roof plans and elevations
4. Design construction detail drawings for complex junctions

13. IFC Data Management
-----------------------

1. Ensure proper classification of all building elements
2. Assign detailed IFC properties to elements
3. Create property sets for energy analysis
4. Implement space boundaries for energy simulation

14. Final Steps and Export
--------------------------

1. Review and refine the entire model
2. Generate a complete set of drawings and schedules
3. Create a basic BIM execution plan

Conclusion
==========

Congratulations on designing a complex multi-storey single-family home!
You've now mastered advanced architectural modeling techniques, complex building systems, and basic site design.

Next Steps
==========

- Explore more advanced site and landscape design
- Dive into detailed energy modeling and analysis
- Learn about parametric design for custom building components
- Investigate BIM collaboration workflows with other disciplines
- Study more advanced structural analysis integration

In the next project, we'll tackle a more complex residential development with multiple units,
introducing concepts like shared walls, parametric design, and clash detection.
