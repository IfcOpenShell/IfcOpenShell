Project 4: Terraced/Town Houses/Duplexes
========================================

In this project, we'll design a row of terraced houses, town houses, or duplexes using Bonsai.
This tutorial will introduce concepts such as shared walls, duplicating units, parametric design,
and collaboration with other stakeholders.

Prerequisites
=============

- Completion of Project 3: Multi-Storey Single-Family Home
- Advanced understanding of Bonsai and IFC concepts

Learning Objectives
===================

- Design shared walls between units
- Create shared roof structures
- Implement complex landscaping for multiple units
- Use parametric design for efficient unit creation
- Generate drawings parametrically
- Perform basic clash detection
- Practice coordination with other stakeholders

3. Shared Walls and Structures
------------------------------

1. Implement shared walls between units
2. Design party wall details for fire and sound separation
3. Create shared foundation elements
4. Model shared roof structures

5. Duplicating and Modifying Units
----------------------------------

1. Duplicate the base unit
2. Implement parametric variations for end units and corner units
3. Create mirrored units for variety
4. Adjust units for site topography

6. Complex Landscaping
----------------------

1. Design shared green spaces
2. Create individual garden areas
3. Model driveways and shared parking areas
4. Implement sustainable drainage systems

7. Parametric Floor Plans
-------------------------

1. Develop a parametric system for generating floor plans
2. Create options for different internal layouts
3. Implement rules for automatic room labeling and area calculations

8. MEP Systems for Multiple Units
---------------------------------

1. Design individual and shared MEP systems
2. Create utility connection points for each unit
3. Model shared building services (e.g., central heating plant)
4. Implement smart metering systems

9. Generating Parametric Drawings
---------------------------------

1. Set up a system for automatic drawing generation
2. Create templates for plans, sections, and elevations
3. Implement automatic dimensioning and annotation
4. Generate schedules for doors, windows, and finishes

10. Clash Detection
-------------------

1. Perform clash detection between architectural and MEP elements
2. Check for clashes between units
3. Verify clearances for accessibility and code compliance
4. Generate clash reports

11. Coordination with Other Stakeholders
----------------------------------------

1. Set up a collaborative BIM environment
2. Create discipline-specific models (structural, MEP)
3. Implement a change management process
4. Use BCF (BIM Collaboration Format) for issue tracking

12. Quantity Takeoff and Cost Estimation
----------------------------------------

1. Generate quantity takeoffs for materials and elements
2. Create cost estimates based on unit types
3. Implement cost comparison between different unit configurations

13. Construction Sequencing
---------------------------

1. Develop a basic construction sequence for the development
2. Create 4D simulations of the construction process
3. Identify critical path activities

14. Sustainability and Energy Analysis
--------------------------------------

1. Perform basic energy analysis for different unit types
2. Implement sustainability features (e.g., green roofs, solar panels)
3. Calculate and compare energy ratings for units

15. Documentation and Deliverables
----------------------------------

1. Generate a complete set of drawings for the development
2. Create marketing materials (e.g., 3D renderings, virtual tours)
3. Prepare a BIM execution plan for the project

Conclusion
==========

Congratulations on designing a complex multi-unit residential development!
You've now mastered advanced concepts in parametric design, collaboration, and project coordination.

Next Steps
==========

- Explore more advanced parametric design techniques
- Dive deeper into BIM collaboration and project management
- Learn about BIM for facilities management and handover
- Investigate integration with GIS for larger site planning
- Study algorithms for optimizing unit layouts and site arrangement

In the final project, we'll scale up to an apartment block, introducing concepts like vertical transportation,
advanced MEP systems, and complex structural analysis.
